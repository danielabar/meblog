I absolutely love podcasts. It's probably safe to assume everyone already knows what a podcast is, but just in case, [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) defines it as "An episodic series of spoken word digital audio files that a user can download to a personal device for easy listening." There are podcasts on every topic under the sun, from comedy, to sports, true crime stories, health, business and everything in between. My favorite categories are programming, personal finance and alternative health.

One of the things I like best about the format is it feels like "hacking the brain". Since they're (mostly) free and so easily accessible, you can be learning and exposing yourself to new ideas while doing the most mundane things like commuting, going for a run, or chores around the house. In this post I'm going to share some opinions on what makes a good podcast. Keep in mind my preference is on education and always learning new things over idle chit chat.

## 1. Not making assumptions about the audiences' knowledge

With the exploding popularity of podcasts, new listeners are always joining in. So even if a podcast has been around for a while and has a distinct target audience (for example, Rails developers or do-it-yourself investors), it's still valuable to briefly define any relevant terms or acronyms that are introduced. Otherwise it can leave some audience members confused or feeling foolish that they're supposed to know what that term means. It doesn't have to take long, just a sentence or two does the trick. Some examples of shows that do a good job of this include [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com/) by Scott Hanselman and [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski.

## 2. Clearly identify ads

Look, I get it, it takes valuable time to create and produce a podcast. Hosting is not free. If there's music and design involved in the logo and website, a designer needs to get paid for that. There are real costs involved in creating quality content, and yet, this content is available for free to everyone. So naturally, most podcasts are ad supported. The few I've heard that don't run ads are sponsored by a company and work in mentions of the company and what services they offer as part of the content. Examples of this include [Financial Decoder](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/financial-decoder) by Charles Schwab, [The Brian Buffini Show](https://www.thebrianbuffinishow.com/) and [Rational Reminder](https://rationalreminder.ca/) by Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore of PWL Capital.

However, for all the others that do run ads, it's important to clearly distinguish the ad from the actual content, otherwise, it can feel like you've been tricked. Some good ways of doing this are a verbal cue such as "And now a word from our sponsor..." or "Let's go to our second sponsor break". Another way is to play some background music that only plays for the duration of the ad and is the same on each episode so listeners can recognize it. Shows that do this well include [Security Now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now) with Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte, [Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/) with Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier and [Techmeme Ride Home](https://www.ridehome.info/podcast/techmeme-ride-home/) with Brian McCullough.
