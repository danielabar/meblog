It's April, the time of year when many Canadians look forward to receiving their tax refunds after having filed their taxes including RRSP contributions. In today's post, I'd like to present an alternative way of looking at this, in which receiving a refund is actually not optimal from a personal finance perspective.

So what's the issue with receiving a large tax refund? Well, given that you've made an [RRSP](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/registered-retirement-savings-plan-rrsp.html) contribution, that's *your* money the government has been holding on to for an entire year. How does this work? Well if you're a T4 employee, your employer deducts federal taxes from your pay every pay period. They do so according to the tax rates for your income. They don't know that you may have contributed to a personal RRSP (leaving aside employer sponsored group RRSP or pension plans as that's another matter not covered in this post) and will be entitled to a refund because the RRSP contribution reduces your taxable income.

Now imagine having access to that money, and being able to save or invest it throughout the year rather than waiting to receive a refund the following year. Well, this is totally possible, and what I refer to as "hacking your RRSP refund". Here's how it works:

After you file your taxes, you'll receive a Notice of Assessment that indicates how much RRSP contribution room you have for the current year. Now suppose you're a prolific saver and have some of this amount ready to contribute right now. You can make a lump sum contribution right away. Then login to the financial institution where you made the contribution and get a statement showing the amount of the contribution. Make a printout of this statement.

Next download a [T1213](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1213.html) form from the Canada Revenue Agency website. This form is a request to reduce tax deductions at source, "source" here means your employer. Fill out the form, sign and print it out, then mail it to the CRA (mailing address is listed on the form). Include the printout of the statement of contribution from your financial institution. Yeah, still using snail mail, government efficiency at work. Essentially what you're saying to the CRA is, look, I've just made a lump sum RRSP contribution, here's the proof, could you please tell my employer to reduce my tax deductions on my payroll.

Now wait a couple months (more government efficiency lol), and the CRA will send you back a letter (wait for it, via snail mail). This letter has instructions for the payroll department at your employer to calculate the reduced federal tax amount for your pay. Submit this form to your employers payroll department. Then starting from the next pay period, you'll see the federal tax deductions on your paystub reduced. This will look like a raise.

Hurray, you made it! You're now getting your "tax refund", through your pay, by getting to keep more of your hard earned money throughout the year.

## Caveats

The total contribution room listed in the Notice of Assessment also includes contributions to an employer sponsored group RRSP or pension plan, including employer matches. If you participate in such a program, make sure to subtract off the estimated amount of this throughout the year, then make sure that together with the lump sum contribution, it's not going over the allowed amount.

This strategy works best for those who have the discipline to take that reduced federal tax amount, and either save or invest it. For those who will be tempted to spend it on needless items, may run into hedonic adaptation - getting used to higher spending, but then not having another lump sum to repeat the process next year, then will feel like a lifestyle deflation when faced with a higher tax amount next year.
