TBD Intro:
* Multiple browser tabs that is, not tabs vs spaces (sorry to disappoint)
* Thought of this after listening to a programming podcast where the discussion turned to the topic of developers who keep massive amounts of browser tabs open, then takes multiple clicks/oops to get to the one they're looking for
* Very common during development to have one tab open on `localhost:port` for your wip project, and then numerous other tabs for various research, how to etc.

TBD rough outline:
* Currently on localhost with lots of other tabs open: multiple-browser-tabs-top.png
* Chrome added a "Search Tabs" feature, Cmd + Shift + A: multiple-browser-tabs-select.png
* Start typing "graph": multiple-browser-tabs-type.png
* Can either keep typing to match exactly or Down arrow to select GraphQL Query options: multiple-browser-tabs-down-arrow.png
* Now on GraphQL Query options tab, suppose want to switch back to localhost (common workflow, working on local development, switch to figure something out like docs, SO etc, update code, then go back to localhost tab)
* Cmd + Shift + A, It remembers the most recent tab you were on, figuring that's where you're most likely to want to go back to: multiple-browser-tabs-remember-previous.png
* Also mention can click on down caret at top right (screenshot?) for those who don't want to memorize yet another keyboard shortcut: multiple-browser-tabs-down-caret.png (TODO: Draw arrow on this screenshot)
* Also mention the other technique via indexing chrome bookmarks reference my previous article
