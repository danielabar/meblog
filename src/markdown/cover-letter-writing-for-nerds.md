I was inspired to write this after encountering a LinkedIn discussion on the topic of cover letters. The debate centered on whether it still makes sense to submit a cover letter with your application in 2024 and beyond? Many on the thread thought it was no longer necessary, and that your resume and/or LinkedIn profile should be sufficient to show why you're a good fit for the job. While I didn't save the link to that specific discussion, a search for "cover letter waste" on LinkedIn will yield many results.

This post will cover why I think cover letters remain valuable and offer a technique to make writing them easier and more effective, especially for techies that use markdown.

Before getting into it, let's briefly define what a cover letter is: A document sent with your resume to provide additional information about your skills and experience. It typically highlights specific achievements and experiences that make you a suitable candidate for the job.

Here's an example from a job application form asking to upload both a resume and cover letter in pdf format. In this particular case, the cover letter is required, although other application forms may mark it as optional:

## Why Cover Letters Are Still Useful

I believe it's definitely still worth spending the time to craft a *custom* cover letter for each role being applied to. In my experience, this has helped my application to get noticed.

That word "custom" is key. Sending a formulaic letter such as...

> I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at [Company Name], as advertised on [Job Board/Company Website]...I have attached my resume for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and experiences will be beneficial to [Company Name]. Thank you for considering my application.

... will not be beneficial, might as well just send your resume and be done with it.

A well crafted cover letter is an opportunity to personalize and tailor your content to the specific role. Think of it as: How to make life easier for HR/recruiters that may be scanning a large number of applications? I do this by highlighting specific phrases or sentences from the job description (JD), then showing how I've developed or used that skill.

A few examples will make this more clear:

Suppose the JD has in the key responsibilities section: "Design, develop and ship major features for existing and new products using Ruby on Rails". Then your cover letter could contain a sentence like:




## The Nerd Way

## TODO
* main content
* examples of specifying: work experience, side project, course, blog post, podcast interview, youtube channel
* organize into sub-sections
* conclusion para
* edit
* Note that even with all this, the most a cover letter will do for you is increase your chances of getting an initial call with HR/recruiter. It does not get you a job.
* Ref: writing can be difficult for engineers, its not often taught as part of tech education and not valued as much as "hard skills"
