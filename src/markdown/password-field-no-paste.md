If you were affected by the [LastPass breach](https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/), you've probably found yourself on various websites changing your password. You may have also noticed that some websites block pasting in a password field. For some reason, the companies behind these seem to think that being able to paste in a password field is insecure. But it's actually the opposite, forcing users to manually type in a password one character at a time encourages the use of weak passwords - shorter and easier to type in, and interferes with password managers. This is a frustrating user experience. This post will show how to work around this issue, when using the Chrome browser.
