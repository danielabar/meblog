VSCode is a great editor for authoring markdown documents. I use it frequently for writing engineering documentation and blog posts. VSCode comes bundled with some Markdown extensions that make authoring easier, such as including snippets to generate markdown syntax such as images, links, bold, etc. For technical writing, a commonly used feature is to generate a block of code that is syntax highlighted according to the language (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc.). This is provided through the `fen` (fenced code block) snippet. However, I ran into a limitation of this snippet where it didn't support all the languages I needed to include in my docs. This post will explain a solution to customizing the list of languages provided by the built-in Markdown extension.

## Fenced Code Block Snippet Overview

Before getting into the solution, here's a quick overview of the fenced code block snippet that ships with VSCode. To see it in action, open or create a new markdown file such as "experiment.md". Then anywhere in the markdown file, type the letters `fen` and hit <kbd class="markdown-kbd">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="markdown-kbd">Space</kbd>. The following intellisense menu will pop up:
