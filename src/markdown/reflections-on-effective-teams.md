I was inspired to write this post after listening to a Software Engineering Radio podcast with guest Jon Smart on the subject of [Patterns and Anti-Patterns for Successful Software Delivery](https://www.se-radio.net/2022/12/episode-543-jon-smart-on-patterns-and-anti-patterns-for-successful-software-delivery-in-enterprises/). He discusses why "Agile Transformation" is an anti-pattern, the importance of focusing on outcomes rather than outputs and avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions. He says the goal shouldn't be to "do agile", but rather introduces a new language of better (quality), sooner (time to value), safer (agile not fragile), and happier (customers, colleagues, citizens, clients).

Listening to this podcast made me reflect on my 20 years experience of software development on various project and product teams across different sized companies and industries in terms of what practices have made some teams more effective than others. In this post, I'll share practices I've experienced that have made teams effective.

But first, what do I mean by an effective team? My definition of this term is a team that can continuously delivery working software that solves their customers problems, keeping the customers happy to keep on paying for the service, and even telling their friends and colleagues about the service. Furthermore, the delivery of subsequent releases introduces little to no [regressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression). Equally important, an effective team consists of team members who feel satisfied and fulfilled in their work and reasonably look forward to starting work each day.

## Product

## Spirit of Agile

- just enough process to keep things sane (every day should not feel like a hack-a-thon), but not too much

## Culture of Writing

## Small-ish Team Size

## Do the Simplest Thing That Works

## Vertical Development

## Automation

- linting
- testing
- CI/CD

## Psychological Safety

Definition from podcast: Ability to feel safe to ask questions, to challenge authority, to have your voice heard, to express your thoughts without fear of repercussion, without fear of being shot down or belittled. Ability to have open, vulnerable conversations with respect. Not having a blame culture. If something goes wrong, its not because someone did something wrong, it's because there was something in the system of work that enabled this thing to happen.

I would add: Not just feeling safe to ask questions and challenge authority, but for it to be encouraged.

## TODO
* Caveat - based on my experience, of course there are many more teams and companies I havenâ€™t worked at that may have different lessons learned, your mileage may vary
