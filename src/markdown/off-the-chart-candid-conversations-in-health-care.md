I usually write about software, systems, and career strategy - things that run on logic, feedback loops, and reasonably clear documentation. This post is different.

Over the past several months, a loved one has been dealing with a serious and complex medical issue. Without going into details, I'll just say that it's involved nearly every touchpoint in the Canadian health care system: emergency rooms, hospital stays, specialists, numerous diagnostic tests, family doctors, bureaucracy, and even surgery.

As a technologist, I'm used to learning systems inside and out. I like to make informed decisions based on clear information. This involves weighing tradeoffs, assessing risks, and choosing the best path forward. But navigating the medical system as a patient advocate has felt less like debugging a system and more like trying to read tea leaves. The hardest part hasn't been the complexity, it's been the communication.

## The Fog of Medical Communication

At almost every step of the process, I've found myself asking questions that don't get clear answers. Not because the clinicians are rude or dismissive (although sometimes this happens), many have been kind and well-intentioned. But the *way* they communicate is often deeply unsatisfying and frustrating.

For example, we were once weighing whether to pursue a less invasive diagnostic test before agreeing to a more invasive and risky surgical procedure. I asked about this less invasive option, and the clinician acknowledged that it existed - but said it was hard to get, involved a lot of paperwork, and wasn't commonly done. I was attempting to get at something like: Are you not recommending it because it's not useful as a diagnostic tool? Or because it's a bureaucratic hassle to get approval? If the test were as easy to order as an ultrasound, would you view it as worthwhile? But I wasn't able to get a straight answer.

That interaction is far from unique. Again and again, I've encountered hedging, vague reassurances, and slippery justifications - but rarely direct, transparent reasoning. It often feels like I'm talking to someone who knows the answer, but is *afraid to say it plainly*.

## Getting Better Answers from an AI?

I've found myself turning to ChatGPT for clearer answers to medical questions. Not because it's better informed. It can absolutely make mistakes, and it doesn’t replace real medical expertise.

But it has an advantage: It's not afraid to be wrong. It doesn’t have a license to protect, or a career on the line. It’s not practicing defensive medicine or navigating institutional liability. It just gives you the information it has, with a disclaimer "AI can make mistakes", and lets you reason through it.

And unlike some clinicians I’ve encountered, it never dismisses my questions as naïve or irrelevant. It doesn't respond with condescension or veiled annoyance. It takes every query seriously, whether I'm asking about a rare side effect or the difference between two blood tests. And when pressed for evidence, it offers links to published research, clinical trials, numerical risk estimates, and can even help in applying this data to a decision-making framework.

That's what I wish I could get from doctors. Not infallibility. Not guarantees. Just a clear, respectful explanation of how they're thinking. What factors they're weighing. What’s real versus what’s just administrative policy or political constraint.

Which got me thinking: why doesn't medicine have an equivalent of *"off the record"?*

## Journalism Has a Tool for This

In journalism, sources and reporters often use the convention of [off the record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)#Ethical_guidelines) to speak more freely. When a conversation is off the record, the journalist agrees not to publish or attribute what the source says. It creates a space for honesty - for sharing context, personal opinions, or sensitive background without fear of consequence.

This convention isn't legally binding, but is culturally understood and respected. They allow journalists and sources to step outside the formal script and get to the heart of things.

## Medicine Needs Something Similar: Off the Chart

So here's my modest proposal: let's create a similar convention for health care. Let's call it **"Off the Chart."**

Off the Chart is a temporary, voluntary agreement between a clinician and a patient (or their advocate) to **step outside the formal medical record** and have a plainspoken, human-to-human conversation.

It's not official advice. It's not part of documentation. It's not consent. It's just a space to ask, "What do you *really* think?"

## How "Off the Chart" Would Work

1. **Mutual Agreement**
   The patient might say:

   > "Can we go off the chart for a minute?"

   The clinician can agree, understanding that this is a signal to temporarily set aside legalese, EMR notes, and institutional protocol.

2. **Informal, Candid Conversation**
   In Off the Chart mode, the clinician might say:

   * "If I'm being honest, that test could help, but the system makes it nearly impossible to get unless you check certain boxes."
   * "I'm not saying this officially, but in most cases like this, people recover without surgery."
   * "If this were my child, I'd push harder for a second opinion."

3. **Return to Clinical Mode**
   After the candid moment, the conversation returns to standard medical practice - documentation, consent, and formal recommendations.

This isn't about replacing medical advice or lowering standards. It's about **adding a communication tool** that acknowledges reality: patients are trying to make huge, life-altering decisions while feeling like they don't have the full picture.

## Why "Off the Chart" Could Help

* **Builds trust** - Patients don't expect perfection. They just want honesty.
* **Respects complexity** - It gives clinicians a space to explain factors like bureaucratic friction, political decisions, or personal judgment that don't fit neatly into a chart.
* **Reduces frustration** - It helps patients understand what's really going on, which can reduce anger, second-guessing, and unnecessary escalation.

And crucially: it could **improve patient outcomes**, because better understanding leads to better decisions.

## Caveats and Realism

"Off the Chart" wouldn't be legally binding or risk-free. There would need to be:

* **Mutual clarity** about its boundaries.
* Training or support for clinicians to know how to use it responsibly.
* Recognition that not every setting (like an ER in crisis mode) allows for it.

But even as a **grassroots cultural convention**, it could be a game-changer.

Just like "off the record" became a widely accepted journalistic tool, "Off the Chart" could become a small phrase that opens big doors for honesty.

## Closing Thoughts

Being sick - or watching someone you love be sick - is already hard enough. But being **left in the dark**, unable to get straight answers or understand the options, makes it infinitely harder.

I don't expect medicine to be perfect. But I do believe it can be **more human**. And sometimes, all that takes is a conversation that's just a little bit **off the chart**.
