A common occurrence when developing a new website or app is that you'd like to see what it will look like on your phone, tablet, or other device. There are several pure software ways to do this, including [Device Mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode) in Chrome developer tools, and [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) which is a paid service with a free option for open source. However, all of these are only approximations of how your site will look and behave on another device. To get a more accurate experience, you need to test on a real physical device. This post will show you how to do that, with whatever devices you happen to have on hand.
