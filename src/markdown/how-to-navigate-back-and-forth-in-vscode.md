If you come from a traditional programming background such as Java or C++, you're probably used to fully featured IDE's such as IntelliJ or Eclipse. Since developers spend a lot more time reading and navigating other people's code than writing it, you'll often find yourself having started in one class/method, which invokes some other method, jump to definition, which invokes another and so-on. Pretty soon you find yourself 10 levels deep in the call hierarchy, then want to navigate back to where you started.
