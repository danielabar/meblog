If you make heavy use of the [Chrome bookmarks](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) feature, then you probably have long lists of them, possibly nested if they're organized with folders and sub-folders.

But it can be kind of a pain to always have to use the mouse to access them. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to access them with the keyboard? As far as I've researched, Chrome does not provide a way to assign keyboard shortcuts to bookmarks, however, it is possible to get that convenience using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

Alfred is a free productivity tool for Mac and has many features. But for the purposes of this post, will just focus on how it can make you more productive accessing your bookmarks.
