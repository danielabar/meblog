TODO: Briefly explain what/how it works - course broken up until short video segments, you can pause, go back, skip forwards, no time limit to complete...

Even prior to the pandemic, I've found this style of learning to be optimal as it supports an async lifestyle. No need to commute to a particular location or be online at a specific hour. You login whenever you have time and go at your own pace. However, there are some pitfalls that can derail the learning experience if you're not careful.

## Passive vs Active

TODO: Movie/popcorn image?

Let's start with what not to do. Don't treat this like a Youtube or Netflix entertainment series, pop some popcorn, sit back, relax and just watch. This is the passive approach, and while not a complete waste of time, it's not the most effective way of learning. Most likely you'll forget most of what's covered.

Instead, I recommend active learning. This requires more explicit effort on the part of the learner and takes longer, but the payoff is more information retained.
