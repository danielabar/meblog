I'm thrilled you've stumbled upon it.\n        With over two decades in software development, I've worked across many\n        industries and technology stacks, predominantly focusing on web\n        applications in projects, products, and SaaS solutions. My journey began\n        with Java, transitioning into full-stack JavaScript with the growing\n        popularity of Node.js and single page apps. Then after brief sojourns\n        into Python and GoLang, I found my professional haven in Ruby on Rails\n        about five years ago. It's in this environment that I've found not only\n        happiness but also peak productivity.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        But let's rewind a bit. My fascination with software development began\n        during my first year at university. An introductory computer course,\n        covering everything from hardware to programming, to networking and\n        theoretical computer science introduced me to the world of coding\n        through the Karel programming language. I was captivated by the elegance\n        of programming, spending countless hours perfecting assignments and even\n        adding extra features just for fun. Little did I know that this newfound\n        passion would become my lifelong career.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        Upon graduation, I landed a role working on a major retailer's\n        e-commerce platform. It was here that the disparity between academic\n        theory and practical application first became apparent. While my formal\n        education had equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science\n        theory, the demands of the job were markedly different. Instead of loop\n        invariants and Big-O complexity analysis, I found myself navigating the\n        intricacies of communicating within a multi-disciplinary team, version\n        control, database management, and the art of translating design comps\n        into pixel-perfect HTML and CSS (before box model standardization!).\n        Fortunately I had several wonderful mentors to guide me through the\n        on-the-job learning process.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        Since then, my career has been defined by a commitment to bridging the\n        gap between theory and practice. As I transitioned from a junior\n        developer to a leadership role as a Staff Engineer, I've made it my\n        mission to advocate for practices that prioritize both efficiency and\n        long-term maintainability. From fostering clear communication with\n        product stakeholders to championing automated testing and CI/CD\n        pipelines, I'm dedicated to nurturing an environment where every\n        engineer thrives.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        Moreover, as an experienced practitioner, I actively mentor and guide\n        fellow engineers, believing strongly in the power of knowledge sharing\n        to elevate the entire team. I'm deeply invested in advocating for\n        architectural improvements, tackling technical debt, and consistently\n        striving for performance optimization and observability best practices.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        Beyond the confines of my organization, I'm passionate about sharing\n        insights and best practices with the broader tech community through\n        blogging. This platform not only serves as a means of personal growth\n        but also as a conduit for sharing programming stories, problem solving\n        techniques, learning strategies, and career development.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        So whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey, I\n        invite you to join me as we explore the ever-evolving landscape of\n        software engineering together. Here's to learning, growing, and building\n        better software, one blog post at a time.\n      </p>\n      <AllLink marginTop=\"30px\" />\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n"],"names":["_ref","marginTop","React","style","Link","to","className","para","About","Layout","SEO","title","pathname","styles","AllLink"],"sourceRoot":""}
