I'm a fullstack software engineer with over 15 years experience delivering consumer facing and large scale enterprise applications. I have experience working with a variety of database, server and client side technologies. I've been especially focused on writing clean, easy to understand code, documentation, test driven development, refactoring, and continuous integration. I'm passionate about ongoing education to learn new technologies, tools and languages."),r.a.createElement("h2",{className:l.a.subheader},"My Story"),r.a.createElement("p",{className:l.a.para},"I discovered software development during first year at university.

This is an ideal introductory language because the syntax is very simple and the scope of what Karel can do is limited. It's a great way to learn the fundamental concepts of programming including variables, loops, control flow and functions, while not getting caught up in complexities of compilers, data types, memory management, and garbage collection (plenty of time for that later!). I enjoyed the programming section of this course so much that I would stay up all night perfecting my homework assignments and even adding extra features just for fun. At some point during first year I learned that people actually get paid to do this and decided to make computer science my major."),r.a.createElement("p",{className:l.a.para},"After graduation I landed a software development job at a big box retailer, working on their e-commerce platform.
