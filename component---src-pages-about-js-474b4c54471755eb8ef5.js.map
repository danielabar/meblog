I'm a software engineer who's been building web applications\n        for over 15 years. My journey has taken me through startups, product\n        companies, and SaaS platforms across financial services, health tech,\n        data infrastructure, and more. Through it all, I've maintained one clear\n        focus: delivering working software that makes a difference.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className={styles.subheader}>What Drives Me</h2>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I'm drawn to the kind of work that makes teams stronger and systems more\n        resilient. That means tackling the foundational improvements such as\n        replacing inefficient search implementations with proper full-text\n        indexing, platform and legacy upgrades, hardening security gaps, or\n        transforming a codebase's architectural patterns so new developers can\n        contribute confidently.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I believe software engineering is about solving real problems for real\n        people, not demonstrating technical cleverness. My job is to understand\n        what needs to happen, communicate the approach clearly, and deliver it\n        in a way that others can maintain and build upon. Readable code beats\n        clever code. Tests that tell a story beat tests that check\n        implementation. Working solutions beat perfect architecture. Documented\n        decisions beat institutional knowledge that lives in peoples heads.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className={styles.subheader}>How I Work</h2>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I'm proactive about identifying problems before they become critical.\n        When I see a revenue gap, a performance bottleneck, or a documentation\n        void, I investigate, propose a solution, and execute it. I don't wait\n        for perfect specifications, instead, I ask clarifying questions, build\n        iteratively, and course-correct based on feedback.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I value transparency and knowledge-sharing. Whether it's through\n        detailed PR reviews, comprehensive documentation, or writing blog posts\n        that demystify complex topics, I invest in making knowledge accessible.\n        Strong teams aren't built on hero developers; they're built on shared\n        understanding and collective capability.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className={styles.subheader}>My Technical Philosophy</h2>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I'm a full-stack generalist with deep expertise in Rails and PostgreSQL.\n        I understand the entire system, from database design and query optimization to\n        service layer to front-end interactivity to CI/CD pipeline\n        configuration. I can navigate architectural decisions with a\n        pragmatic eye toward trade-offs and long-term maintainability.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I embrace modern development practices: comprehensive testing, automated\n        linting, observability with proper monitoring, incremental migrations\n        that avoid big-bang rewrites, and feature flags for safe roll-outs. I\n        also embrace AI-assisted development — not as autopilot, but as a force\n        multiplier that lets me move faster while maintaining engineering rigor.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className={styles.subheader}>What I Value in Teams</h2>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        The best teams I've worked with share a few key traits: they communicate\n        clearly and directly, they trust each other to make good decisions, they\n        document their architectural choices, and they treat production issues\n        as learning opportunities rather than blame opportunities. I thrive in\n        environments where initiative is encouraged, where asking \"why are we\n        doing it this way?\" is welcomed, and where improving developer\n        experience is seen as valuable work.\n      </p>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I don't do leetcode-style interviews - years of public work (GitHub\n        repos dating back to 2013, 100+ blog posts, documented volunteer\n        contributions) offers better evidence of how I think and what I can\n        deliver. Strong technical teams recognize that proven capability matters\n        more than performance on contrived exercises.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className={styles.subheader}>Community & Contributions</h2>\n\n      <p className={styles.para}>\n        I contribute to the broader engineering community through writing and\n        open source work. My technical blog draws thousands of monthly readers\n        and has been featured in Ruby Weekly, Short Ruby Newsletter, and Women\n        on Rails. I write about practical problem-solving, architectural\n        decisions, debugging strategies, and career development.
