Being able to build things that are used in the real world and helping people isâ€¦","html":"<p>A career in software development can be very rewarding. Being able to build things that are used in the real world and helping people is amazing. It can be a surprisingly creative field. It's generally well compensated and most jobs come with good benefits such as health/dental, paid vacation, etc. At the time of this writing, demand for developers far outweighs supply, so employment opportunities are very good (although there can be instability within specific companies or even industries).</p>\n<p>A few years ago a \"Learn to Code\" movement started, encouraging everyone to learn how to program, kind of as a type of literacy. While I believe very strongly that anyone can learn to code, not everyone will necessarily enjoy it enough to want to make it their 9-5 career. So how do you know if its right for you? Over my years as a software developer, I've observed a number of characteristics among myself and colleagues that make up the \"programmer brain\". In this post, I'll go over these so you can decide for yourself if this is something you might like to try.</p>\n<h2>1. Super Math Genius (NOT!)</h2>\n<p>First, let's get a common misconception out of the way. You do not need to be a super genius or have a PhD in mathematics to be a successful programmer. Well maybe if your goal is to work at NASA on a rocket guidance system... But seriously, aside from some specific areas such as computer graphics and animation which require a solid understanding of linear algebra and trigonometry, for most jobs this simply isn't required (not covering AI or Machine Learning in this post as those are completely different areas outside of my expertise). Being logical however, is definitely a must. Some of the most common concepts a programmer encounters are conditionals, as in \"if something is true, then do task A, otherwise, do task B\".</p>\n<h2>2. Curiousity</h2>\n<p>While this may have killed the cat, curiousity most certainly benefits programmers. Being curious about how something works, \"what's under the hood\" so to speak is a good quality to have. For example, if you're reading some code and there's a function call you've never seen before, inspect into it to see what it does. If it's part of the language API, go ahead and look it up in the documentation. Curiousity ensures developers are always learning something new about the code they're working with. If you find yourself frequently asking \"why\" or doing some research on how something works, this is a good sign that you're curious.</p>\n<h2>3. Persistence</h2>\n<p>In programming, code rarely runs exactly right the first time. It may run but not produce the expected result, or it may encounter a runtime error. These error messages can sometimes be helpful in pointing to where the problem lies, or sometimes may be red herrings leading to hours of work trying to solve. Persistence is a useful quality to have here to keep at it, working through the problem until its resolved. If you find that you don't give up easily when facing problems, this is a good sign that you're persistent.</p>\n<h2>4. Analytical</h2>\n<p>Persistence without an equal amount of analytical skills however, leads to insanity. Quite literally, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result. So to make that persistence useful, you need to apply analytic reasoning to the problem. For example, read the error message carefully, then make one modification to the code to try and address the issue, then run the code again. Does the same error result? Or a different error? Try a different change to the code, or start a debug session, or maybe a unit test to verify your understanding of the code. Or maybe the current function you're working on is too large to understand, try breaking it down smaller to isolate just the problem code. This is analytical thinking and is definitely required for programming.</p>\n<h2>5. Not easily frustrated</h2>\n<p>In software development, things rarely work correctly the first time, and require multiple iterations to get right. That's why persistence and analytical skills are so useful. But what's also important is how you feel during this very typical cycle. Some people will interpret the repeated run/debug cycle as a fun challenge or puzzle to figure out. For example, if some code was resulting in an error message, then making a small modification results in a different error message - that's actually progress and something to feel good about. And when it does finally work, a happy dance could be totally appropriate! Others may feel frustrated or exasperated with how much effort it can take to make even seemingly simple things work. Think back to the last time you had to solve a difficult problem - did it feel good to step up to the challenge and solve it or annoying? This feeling will be encountered frequently in software development.</p>\n<h2>6. Detail Oriented</h2>\n<p>Programming is all about the details, lots and lots of details. Of course there's bigger picture thinking as well especially when it comes to architecture and design, but when it comes to the hands-on work of programming, there are many details involved. For example, leaving off the <code>.</code> in css can make a difference between a style being applied or the css being invalid. In JavaScript, one extra equals sign, as in the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> can be significant. If you care about getting the small details right and always put effort into this, then you're detail oriented.</p>\n<h2>7. Optimizer</h2>\n<p>One principle that comes up frequently in software development is \"could we do better?\". There may be some code that solves the problem, but there's always room for improvement. For example, maybe the way it's currently written is confusing, or it's too slow. Or it could be a process that everyone has to follow that involves several manual steps and could instead be automated. It's good to be thinking about ways that the code and process can be improved. You may be an optimizer if you frequently look for ways to improve your life such as automating savings and bill payments, or even re-arranging storage in your home to make more space.</p>\n<h2>8. Enjoy learning new things</h2>\n<p>The field of software development is constantly evolving - there's always a new language, framework, tool or paradigm to learn. What this means is that even if someone is comfortable with their current skills, if they're not frequently learning new skills, it may be harder to land the next job. This can be a plus as things never get boring, on the downside, there is extra effort involved which can extend beyond the 9 - 5. If you enjoy learning new things (eg: via books, courses, video tutorials etc.), then programming could be a good fit. I wrote another post on <a href=\"/blog/how-to-learn-new-things/\">how to learn new things</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you recognize some of these qualities in yourself and have never done any programming, definitely consider taking an introductory workshop or pick up a beginner book. As for what to try, web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) is popular and these skills are in demand. Python is also very beginner friendly. But even if none of these qualities resonate with you, if you're curious about programming I would still encourage everyone to try it and find out for themselves if they enjoy it.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/is-career-in-software-development-right-for-you/"}}},{"node":{"id":"bd15f0ab-32cf-5791-8218-afc9229f0bbc","frontmatter":{"title":"What Makes a Good Podcast","date":"September 2019","category":"podcasts"},"excerpt":"I absolutely love podcasts. It's probably safe to assume everyone already knows what a podcast is, but just in case, Wikipedia defines it asâ€¦","html":"<p>I absolutely love podcasts. It's probably safe to assume everyone already knows what a podcast is, but just in case, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast\">Wikipedia</a> defines it as: \"An episodic series of spoken word digital audio files that a user can download to a personal device for easy listening.\" There are podcasts on every topic under the sun, from comedy, to sports, true crime stories, health, business and everything in between. My favorite categories include programming, personal finance and alternative health.</p>\n<p>One of the things I like best about the format is it feels like \"hacking the brain\". Since they're (mostly) free and so easily accessible, you can be learning and exposing yourself to new ideas while doing the most mundane things like commuting, going for a run, or chores around the house. In this post I'm going to share some opinions on what makes a good podcast. Keep in mind my preference is on education and always learning new things over idle chit chat.</p>\n<h2>1. Not making assumptions about the audiences' knowledge</h2>\n<p>With the exploding popularity of podcasts, new listeners are always joining in. So even if a podcast has been around for a while and has a distinct target audience (for example, Rails developers or do-it-yourself investors), it's still valuable to briefly define any relevant terms or acronyms that are introduced. Otherwise it can leave some audience members confused or feeling foolish that they're supposed to know what that term means. It doesn't have to take long, just a sentence or two does the trick. Some examples of shows that do a good job of this include <a href=\"https://hanselminutes.com/\">Hanselminutes</a> by Scott Hanselman and <a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntax</a> by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski.</p>\n<h2>2. Clearly identify ads</h2>\n<p>Look, I get it, it takes valuable time to create and produce a podcast. Hosting is not free. If there's music and design involved in the logo and website, a designer needs to get paid for that. There are real costs involved in creating quality content, and yet, this content is available for free to everyone. So naturally, most podcasts are ad supported. The few I've heard that don't run ads are sponsored by a company and work in mentions of the company and what services they offer as part of the content. Examples of this include <a href=\"https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/financial-decoder\">Financial Decoder</a> by Charles Schwab, <a href=\"https://www.thebrianbuffinishow.com/\">The Brian Buffini Show</a> and <a href=\"https://rationalreminder.ca/\">Rational Reminder</a> by Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore of PWL Capital.</p>\n<p>However, for all the others that do run ads, it's important to clearly distinguish the ad from the actual content, otherwise, it can feel like you've been tricked. Some good ways of doing this are a verbal cue such as \"And now a word from our sponsor...\" or \"Let's go to our second sponsor break\". Another way is to play some background music that only plays for the duration of the ad and is the same on each episode so listeners can recognize it. Shows that do this well include <a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/security-now\">Security Now</a> with Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte, <a href=\"https://shoptalkshow.com/\">Shop Talk Show</a> with Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier and <a href=\"https://www.ridehome.info/podcast/techmeme-ride-home/\">Techmeme Ride Home</a> with Brian McCullough.</p>\n<h2>3. Limit inside jokes</h2>\n<p>This can happen when there are two or more co-hosts thath know each other well or have a long history of working together. Something will be said that causes all the hosts to start laughing hysterically or go on giggling for some time, but it won't be apparent to the audience what's so funny. This can leave the listener feeling left out of the \"inside joke\".  If you run a podcast and find this happening, try to take a few minutes to fill in the audience on the joke, or if its one of those \"you just had to be there\" moments, try to limit how often it happens or even edit these out.</p>\n<h2>4. Limit the fillers</h2>\n<p>This one's a little tricky because I understand that guests may be nervous, or a new host may not yet have the speaking experience, but try to limit the filler words like umm, ahh, like, you know. These can distract from the main content. This may also depend on the nature of the show. For example those that are more conversational may have a few more filer words than those that are narrated, but as a listener, I really appreciate when everyone speaking is well prepared on the topic. Some great narrated podcasts include <a href=\"https://swindledpodcast.com/\">Swindled</a> and <a href=\"https://apostrophepodcasts.ca/rejection/\">We Regret to Inform You</a>. On the conversational side, some shows that do a great job of this include <a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntax</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money\">Planet Money</a>.</p>\n<h2>5. Signal to noise</h2>\n<p>Wikipedia defines <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio\">signal-to-noise ratio</a> as \"A measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise\". What does this have to do with podcasts you ask? Well, allow me a small tangent... Suppose you have a speaker that emits a small hiss, so even when nothing is playing, if you turn the volume all the way up, you'll hear that hiss get even louder. That's the noise. Now the music you want to play on that speaker is the signal. Imagine if the hiss was really loud, then when you turned up the volume, although the music would get louder, it would partially get drowned out by the hiss, this would be a low signal to noise ratio. Ideally you want a high signal to noise ratio so that the music comes out clearly with little static. Really good explanation of this <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/signal-to-noise-ratio-3134701\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Ok, now back to podcasts. Many will have some level of \"noise\" in some conversational banter or tangents that the hosts go on. The \"signal\" is the topic that's being covered. A good podcast, in my opinion, will limit the amount of noise the audience has to wade through to get to the signal. Of course, some podcasts are all about the banter and that's part of their charm, but I tend to gravitate towards educational shows and so value mostly signal. Some podcasts that do a good balance of banter and education include <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/01/podcast-dear-hbr\">Dear HBR</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/podcasts/motley-fool-money/\">Motley Fool Money</a>.</p>\n<h2>6. Let the guests speak</h2>\n<p>This applies to the interview format - there's a host, and then each week a different guest is brought on to be interviewed. What I've noticed on some podcasts, is the host has a point they'd like to make, so they'll ask a question, but before letting the guest answer, the host keeps going on appending their opinion, so by the time they're finished asking their \"question\", it's lost the flow of the question and answer format. Or sometimes the guest will be interrupted when they're in the middle of answering a question. Presumably the guest was brought on for their expertise in a particular subject. A good podcast will give the guest an opportunity to share their knowledge. A podcast that does this really well is <a href=\"https://www.se-radio.net/\">Software Engineering Radio</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Podcasts are a fantastic way to improve your knowledge on a variety of topics. If you're not already subscribed, I would encourage everyone to download the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_podcatchers\">podcatcher</a> app of their choice and start listening. Over time you'll discover what style you prefer and learn many new things.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/what-makes-a-good-podcast/"}}},{"node":{"id":"a4bd55e6-17c1-567f-9930-0ac8023f5033","frontmatter":{"title":"Off with the Digital Distractions!","date":"September 2019","category":"productivity"},"excerpt":"As a programmer, it's important to have long uninterrupted stretches of time to focus on complex tasks. When working on a difficult task, Iâ€¦","html":"<p>As a programmer, it's important to have long uninterrupted stretches of time to focus on complex tasks. When working on a difficult task, I often have a lot of \"context\" in my head, kind of a house of cards. An interruption will cause the cards to come tumbling down. It can take 20 minutes or more to get back in the zone after an interruption, which is a serious hit to productivity, especially considering the source of potential distractions has exploded in recent years. Ever since the ubiquity of smart phones and social media, these digital interruptions have become a normal part of everyone's day.  In this post, I'll share a few things you can do to minimize these, and get your focus back.</p>\n<h2>1. Phone: Notifications</h2>\n<p>Go to your phone's Notification Settings, go over each app, and unless it's something critical, turn off all Banner, Sound, and Badge notifications. If there's an option to display the Banner on the lock screen, disable that. Otherwise even if your phone is locked, the notification will tempt you to open it. I find the Badge notifications (that orange circled number overlaid on app icons) especially devious, there's something so compelling about seeing, for example a number 3 on the Twitter app icon and wanting to know who's engaged with you. I cannot stress this strongly enough, unless it's part of your job to engage with social media, turn off all social media notifications. And of course, any Sound emanating from your phone will make whatever else you're working on seem less important than responding to the phone.</p>\n<p>I'm not including screenshots of how to do this as the details will vary depending on the phone. To find the steps for your phone, use your favorite search engine to search for example <code>iPhone 11 disable notifications</code> or <code>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 disable notifications</code>.</p>\n<p>Depending on your situation, you may need to leave some of these on, for example, Phone and SMS in case a family member needs to reach you at work if it's an emergency, see next section for how to optimize this.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you're on call and your team uses Pager Duty, you'll have to leave those notifications on.</p>\n<h2>2. Phone: Custom Contacts Tones</h2>\n<p>For myself, the only two apps for which notifications are enabled are Phone and SMS, but even this can be limited. For each contact that is important to me such as family and close friends (i.e. will accept an interruption while at work), I set a custom unique SMS and Ringtone sound per contact. This way if the phone does make a sound, I can distinguish if it's someone in my circle and should answer. All others can wait until my next break. The details for how to do this will vary by phone and version, query your favorite search engine for example <code>iPhone 11 contact ringtone</code> or <code>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 contact sms tone</code>. At first, you may forget who you set to which tone, but over time, you'll start to associate the tones with the most important people in your life.</p>\n<h2>3. Phone: Block Unknown Callers</h2>\n<p>This feature is a relatively new arrival to iPhone, and has been around for a long time on Android. Once enabled, only phone calls from people in your contacts will be allowed through. Calls from people not in your contacts will go straight to voicemail. You will be notified about the missed caller. This is a great way to filter out all those annoying spammy calls like those duct cleaning people, and the \"you owe money on your taxes\" scams.</p>\n<p>One downside to this is if you're expecting a delivery, when they call to notify that they're on the way, you'll miss the call.  So far the only way I've found around this is to remember to disable the block around the hours when delivery is expected. For some people this may be a one-off event (eg: a furniture delivery) and not a big deal, but if you regularly expect deliveries (eg: groceries), it can be annoying. Since I always enter expected deliveries in my calendar, what would be great is if the phone could scan the calendar for a keyword such as \"delivery\", then temporarily lift the block during the hours indicated in the calendar entry. If any phone manufacturer is reading this, please consider this feature request.</p>\n<h2>4. Phone: Do not Disturb Mode</h2>\n<p>An alternative to turning off notifications per app is to set your phone on Do Not Disturb mode during specific hours when you really need to focus. If your focus hours are the same each day, this mode can also be scheduled so that you don't need to remember to turn it on and off each day. However, this will block everything, including Phone and SMS which may or may not work for you. One way around this is to designate some of your contacts as Emergency, or to set them as exceptions to the Do Not Disturb mode. This way if someone in your exception list needs to contact you, they'll get through. One small bug I found with this on my older iPhone model, is that it will make the exception contacts come through via Sound ringtone, even when I've got the phone set to buzz. This can make a lot of people mad at you at the movie theatre, so buyer beware with this option!</p>\n<h2>5. Phone: Airplane Mode</h2>\n<p>This is the nuclear option - block absolutely everything, no exceptions. This could be an ok option for those who really struggle to focus and no one needs to reach them for any emergencies. I'm not aware if this mode can be scheduled so you'd have to remember to turn it back on when you're no longer incommunicado. Personally, I find this a little too heavy handed, and would constantly forget to disable it.</p>\n<h2>6. Laptop: Slack</h2>\n<p>Digital disrputions are not limited to the phone, your work laptop can also be a source of these. The biggest culprit here is Slack (or Teams if you're a Microsoft shop). By default, you'll get a banner and sound notification for every message posted on every channel you're part of, in addition to DMs. The first thing I do when configuring a new work laptop, is to disable ALL sounds from Slack, and disable all notifications except for DMs. I'll also mute less critical channels like social/news/classified etc, and just check them periodically, for example on a lunch break.</p>\n<h2>7. Laptop: Email</h2>\n<p>Whether you use Outlook or Gmail or any other email client, go to the notification settings and turn off all alerts. Outlook and Gmail for example, will both show desktop notifications that will fade or slide in from top or bottom right corner of the screen - turn this off. Most email these days is from bots (Jira notifications, newsletters, etc.) and not critical. My theory is if someone at work needs to reach me urgently, they'll DM me on Slack, so no reason to have email notifications on. I usually check my email first thing when I logon in the morning, and then again around a lunch break. This way it doesn't cause any context switches.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>If you've been losing productivity due to digital distractions, I hope trying some of these tips will help you. Just one final word of caution - before doing any of these, especially the work related apps, check with your manager on expectations around communication. For example, if you receive an email, are you expected to reply within an hour? The next day? How about a Slack message in a team channel? In my opinion, the ideal is a company that values <a href=\"https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/\">asynchronous communication</a> but from my experience, this has been the exception rather than the rule.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/off-with-the-digital-distractions/"}}},{"node":{"id":"f52e4982-9bae-59fe-82c7-1880d09f9df7","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Learn New Things","date":"September 2019","category":"career"},"excerpt":"As a software developer, you constantly have to learn new things to keep up. Some areas, such as front end web development change fasterâ€¦","html":"<p>As a software developer, you constantly have to learn new things to keep up. Some areas, such as front end web development change faster than others but regardless of what area you're working in, there's a good chance that things have changed since you started your career. It's important to keep learning to take advantage of new opportunities and avoid being stuck in the same job forever, or being laid off from that job and struggling to find a new one because your skills have gone out of date.</p>\n<p>So what's the best way to keep up to date? In this post, I'll walk you through several of the ways that I have learned over the years, and share some pros and cons of each.</p>\n<h2>1. University or College</h2>\n<p>This could be a part-time degree, say in computer science, or a certificate program focused on one area such as .NET development, offerred several evenings a week or weekends over the course of several months. This will typically involve several hours of formal in classroom learning with an instructor and other students. Your knowledge will be tested with quizes, assignments and exams. I completed a .NET certificate at a university as part of a continuing education program. The course schedule was two evenings a week from 6 to 9.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Immersive and guided learning experience.</li>\n<li>No distractions, you're in a classroom so there's nothing else to do like watch TV or play video games.</li>\n<li>Requirement to hand in assignments and pass exams keeps students accountable.</li>\n<li>Having instructor available means students are less likely to get stuck because there's someone there to answer questions.</li>\n<li>The longer time horizon means there's more time to absorb the material, especially combined with the mandatory homework assignments.</li>\n<li>This has become less of a benefit in recent years, but some employers do require a formal degree so having that piece of paper can open some doors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High time commitment including commuting to the campus classes, lectures, keeping up with the readings, doing homework assignments and preparing for exams.</li>\n<li>Can be exhausting after a long day of work, to put in another 2-3 hours of class time, then get home late.</li>\n<li>No flexibility in time, the schedule is usually fixed, for example Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 6 to 9. If life gets in the way as it sometimes does, its up to the student to try and find out what they missed.</li>\n<li>The curriculum may be somewhat out of date due to the slow moving bureaucratic university/college environment, as compared to pace of change in tech.</li>\n<li>These types of programs can be expensive. You may be required to purchase textbooks which can be pricey.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Is this for you?</h3>\n<p>This is a good option for those that can commit to the specific schedule, and have lots of free time to keep up with the coursework. This can work well for young, single folks with little to no fanily commitments. This is also a good choice for people who get distracted easily at home and prefer to be out at a particular location for learning. On the other hand, if you have a hectic home/personal life, or a job that regularly requires staying late to put out fires, this option may not work for you. You'll be constantly stressed trying to make it to class or may have to miss several lessons. For myself, I did this earlier in my career, but the fixed schedule wouldn't work for me now.</p>\n<h2>2. In Person Workshops</h2>\n<p>These also occur in a classroom with an instructor, but are more condensed, for example 1 or 2 days, or a week long workshop. They will typically focus on one specific area, for example React or SVG animations. Unlike university courses, there are no exams or homework assignments. I've done a few of these including a week long EJB course (eons ago), and a 2 day AngularJS workshop several years back. There will be hands-on exercises and students are typically required to bring their own laptops.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Immersive and guided learning experience.</li>\n<li>No distractions, you're in a classroom so there's nothing else to do like watch TV or play video games.</li>\n<li>Having instructor available means students are less likely to get stuck because there's someone there to answer questions.</li>\n<li>Tend to be run by smaller companies that can be more nimble in setting the curriculum, so the topics taught will be more current.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No flexibility in the schedule, these types of courses typically run 9 to 5 during the week so you need to be able to get the time off work in order to take them. If you need to leave early, for example to pick up a child from school, you'll miss the material.</li>\n<li>A lot of material gets squeezed into a relatively short amount of time, can be difficult to absorb all this in just a few sessions. In my experience they start off slow paced on the first day, then instructor realizes by afternoon of last day how much material there's yet to be covered and quickly whips through remaining material, leaving student's heads spinning.</li>\n<li>Can be very pricey, although usually the price will include all learning materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Is this for you?</h3>\n<p>This option is best if your employer will pay for it and give you the time off to attend. This is most likely to happen if the material is relevant to what you're currently working on. You also have to be ok with not understanding everything right away because the pace may be too fast, and commit to catching up on your own later. My personal experience with these is that an impressive amount of material is covered, but tends to go by too fast for me to absorb. By the time I get around to reviewing it later, have forgotten the context of what the instructor was talking about at that moment.</p>\n<h2>3. Online Workshops</h2>\n<p>These are structured very similar to the in-person workshops but they're online rather than in person. Some like <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/\">Frontend Masters</a> offer their courses in both in-person and online formats simultaneously. If you happen to live nearby the city where the course is being held, you can attend in person, otherwise you'll be watching it live streamed from your computer at home. There's a live chat in the sidebar where students can post their questions while the instructor is teaching. At the end of each section, a facilitator will aggregate the questions for the instructor. They also make the videos available to participants later for review. I've taken several of these including <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript/\">Hardcore Functional Programming in JavaScript</a> and <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svg-animation/\">Advanced SVG Animation</a>. From my experience, these have similar pros and cons of in person workshops.</p>\n<h2>4. Books</h2>\n<p>There are countless programming books available from Amazon, O'Reilly, Manning, and many more. Some are more theoretical and can be read like a novel. Others are more practical walking you through code examples. For these, I highly recommend purchasing the physical book and investing in a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=book+stand+for+textbook&#x26;crid=S7QWYI010DPM&#x26;sprefix=book+stand%2Caps%2C145&#x26;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_10\">book stand</a> so you can prop the book upright beside your monitor. This is healthier for your neck than craning forward to read the book flat on the desk. Most books will also be available in e-formats but I've found the code formatting doesn't turn out as well as on physical printed pages.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ultimate in time flexibility, you learn on your own time, whenever you have time.</li>\n<li>You can put the book down after reading just one concept, then take the time to explore it on your own. For example, modify some of the code samples, lookup the documentation to learn more about a particular api, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are many distractions at home such as the fridge, TV, crying baby etc, it will be difficult to focus and make progress.</li>\n<li>If you get stuck, for example a code sample doesn't compile, there's no one to immediately ask for help. Of course you can \"ask the internet\" but this makes the experience asynchronous and can disrupt the learning flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Is this for you?</h3>\n<p>Books are great for those who have a lot of self discipline and are able to set aside some quiet time on a somewhat regular basis and focus on learning. It's also good for those with a variable schedule because you can choose when to study. This is another option I used earlier in my career to learn topics such as Clean Code, Refactoring, Design Patterns, Java, HTML, and CSS. For books with more prose, this was great. But for books with a lot of code, I found the transition from written page to screen and back a little jarring, like it would take time to get back to the line I had left off in the book. It seems small but these little context switches make it hard for me to focus.</p>\n<h2>5. MOOCs</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course\">wiki page</a>, a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) is \"an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web\". These are often university level courses taught by university professors. They're offerred by a variety of institutions, Coursera was one of the first in this market, but now there's others such as individual universities, Udemy, edX and <a href=\"https://www.classcentral.com/providers\">many others</a>.</p>\n<p>They follow a schedule, although not quite as rigid as in-classroom. Typically a new lecture is released each week along with a homework assignment that is due within a week or two. Some may require completion of a capstone project in addition to the weekly assignments and/or a final exam. You can watch the lectures at any time after they've been released, but in order to get full credit, the homework assignment must be completed on time. There is also a student forum, moderated by teaching assistants (TA) where students can post questions and receive answers from either the TAs or other students. Some courses may require the purchase of a textbook.</p>\n<p>I've taken a few of these including <a href=\"https://www.mooc-list.com/course/interactive-computer-graphics-webgl-coursera\">Interactive Computer Graphics with WebGL</a> at Coursera and <a href=\"http://ivmooc2018.cns.iu.edu/\">Information Visualization</a> at Indiana University. For the WebGL course, each homework assignment was to build an interactive application using what we'd learned that week, <a href=\"http://danielabar.github.io/coursera-webgl/\">here is what I built</a>. For the Information Visualization, the capstone project had us working in small teams to build a visualization for a client, the university arranged for several organizations to make their datasets available for this purpose. <a href=\"http://danielabar.github.io/globi-proto/#/landing\">Here is the project</a> my team built and the <a href=\"https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/GloBI_Explorer_Interactive_Ecosystem_Explorer/1414253\">paper</a> we self published on Figshare.</p>\n<p>Sometimes MOOCs can be offered by companies that make a specific product, to improve knowledge of how to use that product. An example is MongoDB, which has <a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB University</a>. I took several courses here including M101JS: MongoDB for Node Developers, this one no longer seems to be offered but here are my <a href=\"http://danielabar.github.io/m101js/#/\">course notes</a>. I also took <a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M201/about\">M201</a> on MongoDB Performance. My <a href=\"https://github.com/danielabar/mongo-performance\">course notes</a> on github are fairly popular.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Democratises education by making elite university courses available to all.</li>\n<li>Assignments and exams reinforce learning.</li>\n<li>Somewhat flexible schedule, you watch the lectures from home, or anywhere you have a laptop and internet access, when you have time.</li>\n<li>Courses are free, or relatively low cost (compared to taking an actual in person class).</li>\n<li>Student forums provide some interactivity and ability for students to get \"unstuck\" if they run into problems with the assignments, or having trouble understandng a concept.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High workload, could be anywhere from 6 to 10 hours a week required to keep up with lectures, assignments, project work and studying for tests and exams.</li>\n<li>Even though you can watch the lectures whenever you have time, in practice if you don't keep up and watch them shortly after they're released, you'll be at risk of falling behind.</li>\n<li>Although the student forums can be useful, they're still asynchronous (i.e. could be a day or more delay between asking a question and getting an answer), and there's no obligation for anyone to answer (although most questions do get answered within a day).</li>\n<li>For the free ones, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60e90be2-1a77-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d\">dropout rates</a> are quite high.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Is this for you?</h3>\n<p>MOOCs are a great option for those who can dedicate the necessary hours each week, but may have too variable of a schedule or live too far away to attend in person classes. Skip this if you don't have the discipline to sit down and study though. The material is challenging and there is no accountability, i.e. no one's taking attendance or going to follow-up with you if you don't submit an assignment.</p>\n<h2>6. Screencasts/Subscriptions</h2>\n<p>These are online courses that are completely self paced. They tend to be on very specific topics and involve many hands-on coding exercises which you can follow along with the instructor. An entire course may run several hours in total instruction time but will be usually be broken up into shorter 5 to 10 minute screencasts. Some examples of these include <a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/\">Pluralsight</a> which offers a subscription based service. For a monthly or annual fee you can watch an unlimited number of courses on a huge variety of programming and IT topics. Others include <a href=\"https://wesbos.com/\">Wes Bos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro\">Level Up Tutorials</a>. Some will offer a Q&#x26;A forum or Slack channel where students can ask questions.</p>\n<p>This is my favorite style of learning and I've taken many of these courses on a variety of topics including Ruby, GatsbyJS, VueJS, Rails, Docker, Golang and many more. To get the most out of it, I frequently pause the videos to make notes and try out the exercises. This makes the learning more active  and helps the material \"stick\". You can find my <a href=\"https://github.com/danielabar?tab=repositories&#x26;q=pluralsight&#x26;type=&#x26;language=\">course notes</a> on Github.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Same flexibility as with books, all study is done at home whenever you have time.</li>\n<li>Short video format supports learning even for those with very busy schedules.</li>\n<li>Very current and relevant topics, new courses are released frequently.</li>\n<li>Cost varies, but tends to be less than the in person workshops. Some like Wes Bos even offer a few <a href=\"https://wesbos.com/courses\">free courses</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No homework assignments or exams means there's no way to validate that you've learned the material correctly.</li>\n<li>Video format can be a little too passive - if you sit back and watch it like a TV show, won't absorb that much.</li>\n<li>Complete lack of schedule makes it easy to procrastinate, \"I'm too tired now, will watch a video tomorrow\".</li>\n<li>Easy to get stuck, for example the versions of some libraries may have changed, or instructor may have small bug in their code, this can be a challenge for beginners.</li>\n<li>Just like MOOC's, the student forums can be helpful, but will be asynchronous. In my experience with Pluralsight, some questions get answered in a few days, some never do.</li>\n<li>Again like MOOCs, there's no accountability - if you pay for a subscription and never use it, it's your loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Is this for you?</h3>\n<p>This style of learning is great for people who don't have a lot of regular time to dedicate to learning, and are comfortable with having things not work exactly as it does in the screencast and are able to troubleshoot on their own. Skip this if you're an extreme procrastinator or need more accountability to get things done.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts on learning</h2>\n<p>If you're not sure what style of learning is right for you, go ahead and try a few different ones. That's what I did and eventually reached the conclusion that self-paced screencasts work best for me.</p>\n<p>No matter which style of learning you choose, you'll get the most out of it by taking an active approach rather than passive. This means making notes about what you're learning and doing hands-on exercises where possible. After each section, pause and try to write down what you've just learned in your own words. If you're struggling with this, it means you didn't quite grasp the concept so go ahead and read/listen again until you do understand it. Also, rather than just watch the instructor run some code, make sure to setup your development environment with all the libraries, compilers etc. and try it out for yourself. Then make some modifications and see if that works, if not, figure out why by looking up the API/documentation.</p>\n<p>Regarding the expense, some employers will reimburse employees for continuing education. Definitely ask your boss or HR department if there is such a program where you work and what are the requirements. For example, you may be required to pay up front, then present some evidence of successful completion before being reimbursed.</p>\n<p>And finally, keep on learning.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-learn-new-things/"}}},{"node":{"id":"bced2f8c-0a41-55e8-b51c-abb025524dac","frontmatter":{"title":"Crossword Solver with CentOS","date":"August 2019","category":"just for fun"},"excerpt":"If you enjoy crossword puzzles but sometimes get stuck on a devious one, here's a fun use of the CentOS words package.
