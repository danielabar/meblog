Since developers spend a lot more time reading and navigating other people's code than writing it, you'll often find yourself having started in one class/method, which invokes some other method, jump to definition, which invokes another and so-on. Pretty soon you find yourself 10 levels deep in the call hierarchy, then want to navigate back to where you started.</p>\n<p>Reference for Eclipse: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3095318/how-to-go-back-in-eclipse\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3095318/how-to-go-back-in-eclipse</a>\nReference for vs code: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35424367/how-to-navigate-back-to-the-last-cursor-position-in-visual-studio-code\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35424367/how-to-navigate-back-to-the-last-cursor-position-in-visual-studio-code</a></p>\n<p>TBC...</p>","fields":{"slug":"/how-to-navigate-back-and-forth-in-vscode/"}}},{"node":{"id":"0a4acf8a-dd9e-5390-9dea-b07f2083d8d2","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Access Chrome Bookmarks via Keyboard","date":"August 2019","category":"productivity"},"excerpt":"If you make heavy use of the Chrome bookmarks feature, then you probably have long lists of them, possibly nested if they're organized with…","html":"<p>If you make heavy use of the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&#x26;hl=en\">Chrome bookmarks</a> feature, then you probably have long lists of them, possibly nested if they're organized with folders and sub-folders.</p>\n<p>But it can be kind of a pain to always have to use the mouse to access them. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to access them with the keyboard? As far as I've researched, Chrome does not provide a way to assign keyboard shortcuts to bookmarks, however, it is possible to get that convenience using <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a>.</p>\n<p>Alfred is a free productivity tool for Mac and has many features.
