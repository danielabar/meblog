One way to keep on top of this is to set aside some time once a year to call all your service providers and negotiate a better rate (or get rid of the service altogether if its not providing any value).</p>\n<p>Stories like <a href=\"https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2019/08/22/1000-per-hour/\">this one</a> of saving ~$1000 on a yearly basis from just an hour on the phone are very compelling. So when a few months ago I received a notice of my cell phone bill going up by $3/month, I was very motivated to call my provider to avoid this increase, and perhaps get an even better price. $3/month works out to $36/year so that's certainly worth a quick phone call (ignoring taxes for this story, just to keep all the numbers simple). Here's how it went:</p>\n<p>One quick note first - all the customer service reps I spoke to on this journey were very nice and doing their best to be helpful. If this comes off as sounding critical, it's my frustration at the provider/system as a whole, not any individual working there.</p>\n<h2>Call One</h2>\n<p>The first customer service rep (CSR) I spoke to had some great news. Not only could she save me the $3/month increase, there was a new plan available that would save me $35/month compared to my current rate. I carefully confirmed with her that <em>all</em> the features of my existing plan would still be available on the new plan and she assured me that was the case. So I went ahead with the switch.</p>\n<p>Duration: Half hour on the phone.</p>\n<p>At this point I was feeling very pleased with myself having saved $35 * 12 = $420/year with just a half hour of work. But little did I know what was to come. About 10 minutes later I received an email confirmation from the service provider about the plan change. Looking over the features, there was no data listed. This was a big problem as I definitely had a data plan before.</p>\n<h2>Call Two</h2>\n<p>So I called back the provider. This CSR told me that the previous CSR had made a mistake. The new plan I was on had no data. The cheapest data plan they had available was $5/month <em>more</em> than what I was paying originally. At this point it was better to go back to my original + $3/month increase (the original notification that had started this whole process).</p>\n<p>Now this is where things started to get hairy. This CSR told me it was impossible to go back to my old plan because it no longer existed. How is that possible? It was just there 15 minutes ago before making the switch. She told me it was a legacy plan that was no longer available. My options were to stay with the new cheaper plan but have no data, or go up to the more expensive plan.</p>\n<p>None of the personal finance articles I had read about saving money on monthly expenses mentioned this risk of... let's call it an administrative snafu. I asked the CSR if there was anything else she could do as it wasn't right for the previous CSR to have removed me from my old plan if the new plan didn't have all the features she had confirmed. After much time on hold I got transferred to another CSR who said she would try and help me. Eventually she found an option where I could pay $5/month less than my original plan, and it would include 1GB of data. This was a lot less data than what I had originally, but could work, certainly during Covid when I don't go out much in any case. So I told her to go ahead with the switch.</p>\n<p>Duration: One hour on the phone.</p>\n<p>After all this effort, I had managed to save only $5/month * 12 = $60/year, with one and a half hours of work total. Together with loss of data, this didn't feel like such an achievement. But oh well, I tried to follow the personal finance savings advice. Unfortunately things got worse.</p>\n<h2>Call Three</h2>\n<p>When next month's bill arrived, I was very surprised that it was $12 <em>higher</em> than my old bill! How could this be possible when I had switched to a <em>cheaper</em> plan? Once again on the phone with a CSR. This one explained to me that the reason for the higher bill was due to pro-rating because I had switched in the middle of the billing period. But this explanation didn't pass the sniff test. When switching from a more expensive to cheaper plan mid cycle (my switch was about half way through), the next bill should have 50% of the charge from the expensive plan, and 50% from the cheaper plan, which would end up with a bill somewhere in between the expensive and cheaper plan. <a href=\"https://www.billsby.com/2019/12/26/explained-what-is-pro-rating-and-how-can-you-use-it-in-your-subscription-business\">This post</a> has a simple explanation of pro-rating. It's impossible for the next bill to end up greater than the more expensive plan. It must, by definition of pro-rating come out somewhere in between. But apparently subscription arithmetic is not part of the training curriculum at this service provider as the CSR kept insisting the reason for the $12 increase was due to pro-rating.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I kept digging into the bill trying to make sense of it, and finally found the culprit. My provider had added a $12 service charge for changing plans mid cycle. When I mentioned this to the CSR he dropped the pro-rating argument and confirmed there is a charge for switching mid cycle. I pointed out that the previous CSR had not informed me of this, had I known, would have waited till end of billing cycle to change plans. This CSR agreed I should have been told and issued me a credit (to appear on next bill) for the service charge.</p>\n<p>Duration: Another hour on the phone.</p>\n<p>For those keeping track, that's two and a half hours of work for a savings of $60/year, less data, <em>and</em> a whole lot of aggravation. This definitely wasn't mentioned in any of the personal finance articles about saving on monthly expenses. They make it seem so simple, just a quick phone call to your service providers and poof, money saved. The story continues...</p>\n<p>About a week later, I received another notification about my eligibility for yet another plan that was $15/month less than my original and had nearly as much data as I used to have. Had to give this some serious thought - should I call and switch plans yet again? The potential savings were $15/month * 12 = $180/year. But what if things went sideways again? Decided to take a chance as I had already spent so much time, might as well try to save a little more. Kind of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost\">sunk cost fallacy</a> but with regards to time.</p>\n<h2>Call Four</h2>\n<p>On the phone again, another CSR. Again confirmed every single feature was available on the new plan. Again it was mid-cycle, and CSR made no effort to warn me about the mid cycle service charge, but I had learned my lesson and insisted on the plan change taking effect at the beginning of the next cycle. Who knows whether it's a lack of training that the CSRs don't mention the mid cycle service charge or a strategy on the part of the provider, figuring most customers won't bother to challenge it.</p>\n<p>This time, things worked out fine. My next bill for the new plan arrived at $15 less than what I was paying before, and no surprise charges.</p>\n<p>Duration: Half hour on the phone.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The final tally is 3 hours of work to save $180/year and staying at roughly equivalent service, which works out to $60/hour for my efforts. Was it worth it? Well I'm happy to be saving money but not sure it was worth all the aggravation - potential loss of service, all that time on hold, debating with CSRs. This is something to think about when embarking on a money saving task -  how much money could be saved vs the value and opportunity cost of your time to do it. It may not always be worth it.</p>\n<h2>Related Content</h2>\n<p>The following section contains affiliate links for related content you may find useful.

This monolith needs to make use of a new subscription service that is developed as a separate project with Rails 6. The subscription service also runs dockerized with docker-compose. Why run them with Docker locally? <a href=\"/blog/dockerize-rails-app-for-dev-debug-and-testing\">I've written about the benefits of this approach and how to do it here</a>.</p>\n<p>Communication between the services is via an HTTP api. Specifically, the monolith needs to make GET/POST/PATCH requests to the subscription service to access services such as creating a new subscription, getting a list of active subscriptions for a user, cancelling a subscription, etc.</p>\n<p>The monolith runs the Rails server on port 3000 and the subscription service runs on port 4000. If the services were running natively on the laptop, the monolith could address the service via <code>localhost</code>, for example, <code>GET http://localhost:4000/api/subscriptions</code>. But this won't work when the monolith is running in a Docker container because it will look for a service running on port 4000 <em>within the container</em>, which does not exist.</p>\n<p>One solution is to build an image of the subscription service, push it to a Docker registry (self hosted, Docker Hub, Github container registry etc.) then add another service in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> of the monolith that uses this image. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"yml\" data-index=\"0\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk3\"># docker-compose.yml in the monolith project</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">version</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;3.3&quot;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">services</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk7\">web</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">build</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      </span><span class=\"mtk7\">context</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk4\">.</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk4\">...</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk7\">mysubapp</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">image</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">https://path/to/registry/your-organization/project-name:image-tag</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">ports</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      - </span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;4000:4000&quot;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk4\">...</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Then the monolith could make requests to the subscription service using the service label given in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, for example: <code>GET http://mysubapp:4000/api/subscriptions</code>.</p>\n<p>However, in my case, both applications (the monolith and subscription service) are in active development, so I needed the flexibility to make changes to both and have the changes be reflected immediately. Having to build an image each time and push to a registry (or even host it locally) would have created too much friction.</p>\n<h2>Docker Compose Networking</h2>\n<p>Another solution is to use docker compose networking. Recall I mentioned that both projects have their own docker compose file and are run via <code>docker-compose up</code>. The subscription service <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file has:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"yml\" data-index=\"1\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">version</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;3.3&quot;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">services</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk7\">api</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">buiild</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      </span><span class=\"mtk7\">context</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk4\">.</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">ports</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      - </span><span class=\"mtk6\">4000:4000</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk3\"># remainder of services...</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Running <code>docker-compose up</code> creates a default network named <code>your-project_default</code>. To view all the docker networks run, <code>docker network ls</code>. For example, when I'm running both the monolith (<code>app</code>) and the subscription service (<code>subapp</code>), my networks are:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"\" data-index=\"2\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">$ docker network ls</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">NETWORK ID     NAME                DRIVER    SCOPE</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">4c70ec63569c   bridge              bridge    local</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">506eb008c078   host                host      local</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">9e95129ab709   app_default         bridge    local</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">0029021041d2   none                null      local</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">6bf8ff8bc594   subapp_default      bridge    local</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Since I want the <code>web</code> service in the monolith to address the <code>api</code> service in the subscription project, this can be accomplished by having the app <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/#use-a-pre-existing-network\">join</a> the subscription services' network using the <code>external</code> option:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"yaml\" data-index=\"3\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk3\"># docker-compose.yml in monolith</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">version</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;3.3&quot;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">services</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk3\"># all the services...</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk3\"># Join the subcription service network</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">networks</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk7\">default</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">external</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      </span><span class=\"mtk7\">name</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">subapp_default</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>And now the monolith app can make an http request such as <code>GET http://subapp_api_1:4000/api/subscriptions</code>. Where <code>subapp</code> is the project name of the subscription service and <code>api</code> is the service name defined in its <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. To confirm that these services can communicate with each other, run <code>docker network inspect subapp_default</code> and it will list all the services that are participating in this network.</p>\n<h2>Blocked Host Error</h2>\n<p>At least in theory this should work. In practice, when the monolith made an http request to <code>GET http://subapp_api_1:4000/api/subscriptions</code>, received a Rails html error page with the following error message:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"4\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h1</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Blocked host: subapp_api_1&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h1</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;To allow requests to subapp_api_1, add the following to your environment configuration:&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">pre</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;config.hosts </span><span class=\"mtk8\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> &quot;subapp_api_1&quot;&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">pre</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>This error comes from new <a href=\"https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/HostAuthorization.html\">ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization</a> middleware that guards against DNS rebinding attacks by explicitly permitting the hosts a request can be sent to. What was puzzling about receiving this error is that this middleware is newly added to Rails 6, but it was being sent by the Rails 5 container running the monolith code.</p>\n<h2>Debugging Attempts</h2>\n<p>On the off chance this middleware had gotten back ported to Rails 5, I tried adding the line <code>config.hosts &#x3C;&#x3C; \"subapp_api_1\"</code> entry to <code>config/environments/development.rb</code> exactly as recommended by the error message. But then the Rails 5 server failed on startup running this initialization with an error that the <code>config</code> object has no such method <code>hosts</code>. This makes sense as this feature is only present as of Rails 6, but then <em>why</em> was I receiving this message from Rails 5???</p>\n<p>It was also possible that I misunderstood the message and that the host configuration should be added on the Rails 6 container (the one running the subscription service) to make sure it could communicate back to the Rails 5. Even though the subscription service didn't need to make any http requests to the monolith, sometimes when you're debugging, just need to try a bunch of things, if nothing else, to rule them out. So added <code>config.hosts &#x3C;&#x3C; \"app_web_1\"</code> to <code>config/environments/development.rb</code> on the Rails 6 project, restarted it, but this had no effect, was still getting the same error.</p>\n<p>Also ran <code>bundle exec rake middleware</code> which lists all the middleware in sequence, to investigate whether the monolith project had a library or custom middleware that was implementing host blocking, but couldn't find any.</p>\n<p>Another possibility could have been that the networking wasn't working and the containers couldn't really \"see\" each other. To verify this, I ran ran a shell in the container running the Rails monolith: <code>docker exec -it app_web_1 bash</code>. Then checked if it could \"see\" the subscription service with <code>ping subapp_api_1</code>, and indeed it could communicate.</p>\n<p>Ok well if they can communicate at a network level, what about running <code>curl</code> in the shell (still in the Rails 5 container)? Tried <code>curl http://subapp_api_1:4000/api/subscription</code> (along with necessary auth headers), and <em>amazingly</em>, this also returned the Rails 6 html error page <code>&#x3C;h1>Blocked host: subapp_api_1&#x3C;/h1></code>!</p>\n<p>At the same time, I was monitoring the log files for the container running the subscription service and there was no activity there, confirming that the http requests were never getting past the Rails 5 container.</p>\n<h2>Solution: Docker Cleanup</h2>\n<p>After nearly a day of investigation, my manager suggested wiping out all the Docker things to get a fresh start. Was it possible that somehow the Rails 5 and 6 image layers had gotten mixed up? Seems strange but at this point had exhausted all the other possibilities so why not try this.</p>\n<p>When using Docker and docker-compose, there will be a variety of docker images, containers, networks and volumes. Although it is possible to list each type and remove them one at a time, it's faster to wipe them all out in one go. To start, make sure there are no running containers by running <code>docker ps</code>. If any are listed, stop them with <code>docker stop {container ID or name}</code> OR go to the project directory where docker-compose was started and stop it. Then run:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"\" data-index=\"5\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">$ docker system prune -a</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>This will remove all images, containers, and networks. It will not remove volumes however. This is a kind of safety as there might be valuable data that should be backed up. In my case, all volumes contain only development data which can be easily recreated by running <code>bundle exec rake db:seed</code>. To have system prune also remove volumes run:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"\" data-index=\"6\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">$ docker system prune -a --volumes</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>After this I re-ran <code>docker-compose up</code> in both projects which built/downloaded all images from scratch, ran the scripts to re-seed data in both projects, then tried the code to <code>GET http://subapp_api_1:4000/api/subscriptions</code> from the monolith and it worked!</p>\n<p>I'm curious if you've had mysterious issues resolved by a Docker cleanup?

A time when Canadians start shedding their winter layers, setting out the patio furniture, and looking forward to their tax refunds after having filed their taxes including RRSP contributions.</p>\n<p>In today's post, I'd like to present an alternative way of looking at this, in which receiving a refund is actually not optimal from a personal finance perspective.</p>\n<p>What's the issue with receiving a large tax refund? Well, given that you've made an <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/registered-retirement-savings-plan-rrsp.html\">RRSP</a> contribution, that's <em>your</em> money the government has been holding on to for an entire year. In other words, you've effectively given the government a one year interest free loan, probably not what most people intended.</p>\n<p>How did this happen? Well if you're an employee, your employer deducts federal taxes from your pay every pay period. They do so according to the tax rates for your income. They don't know that you may have contributed to a personal RRSP and will be entitled to a refund because the RRSP contribution reduces your taxable income (leaving aside employer sponsored group RRSP or pension plans as that's another matter not covered in this post).</p>\n<p>Now imagine having access to that money, and being able to save or invest it throughout the year rather than waiting to receive a refund (aka your money) the following year. Well, this is totally possible, and what I refer to as \"hacking your RRSP tax refund\". Here's how it works:</p>\n<p>After filing taxes, you'll receive a Notice of Assessment that indicates how much RRSP contribution room you have for the current year. Now suppose you're a prolific saver and have some of this amount ready to contribute right now. You can make a lump sum contribution right away, for example, by transferring some funds from a taxable savings account to an RRSP account. Then login to the financial institution where you made the contribution and get a statement showing the amount of the contribution. Make a printout of this statement.</p>\n<p>Next download a <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1213.html\">T1213</a> form from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website. This form is a request to reduce tax deductions at source, \"source\" here means your employer. Fill out the form, print and sign it, then mail it to the CRA (mailing address is listed on the form). Include the printout of the statement of contribution from your financial institution. Yes this process relies on snail mail for now, hopefully one day it could be done online. Essentially what you're saying to the CRA is: \"Look, I've just made a lump sum RRSP contribution, here's the proof, could you please tell my employer to reduce the tax deductions on my payroll\".</p>\n<p>Now wait a few months, eventually, the CRA will mail back a letter with instructions for the payroll department at your employer to calculate the reduced federal tax amount for your pay. Give a copy of this letter to the payroll department at your workplace. Keep the original for your records.</p>\n<p>Then starting from the next pay period after payroll has applied the change, the federal tax deductions on your paystub will be reduced accordingly. The reduction on each pay will be roughly equal to the tax refund you would have gotten next year, divided by the number of remaining pay periods in the current year. It will feel like getting a raise.</p>\n<p>Hurray, you made it! You're now getting the tax refund, through your pay, by getting to keep more of your hard earned money throughout the year.</p>\n<h2>Caveats</h2>\n<p>The total contribution room listed in the Notice of Assessment also includes contributions to an employer sponsored group RRSP or pension plan, including employer matches. If you participate in such programs, make sure to subtract off the estimated amount of this throughout the year. Then make sure that together with the lump sum contribution is not greater than the allowed contribution room as listed in the Notice of Assessment. Otherwise this may incur a fine from over contributing.</p>\n<p>This strategy works best for those who have the discipline to take that reduced federal tax amount, and either save or invest it. For those who will be tempted to spend it on needless items, this may result in hedonic adaptation. In other words, getting used to higher spending, but then not having another lump sum to repeat the process next year, then will feel like a lifestyle deflation when faced with the regular tax amount next year.</p>\n<h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>Have to include an obligatory disclaimer here: The above post is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered legal or financial advice.

For a more detailed explanation, read on...</p>\n<p>I recently starting using <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\">Heroku</a> to deploy a side project built with Rails and Postgres. Heroku is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that makes it really easy to deploy web applications, and other related services such as a database. Since I'm not currently monetizing my side project, I selected the free tier, together with the Hobby Dev package for the database, which provides a limited amount of storage.</p>\n<p>One thing you might like to do once there's some significant amount of production data in the database, is to make a copy of it to import into a locally running database. For local development you'd usually be using fake or test data (i.e. seeds in Rails). However, it can sometimes be useful to develop against real data. For example, when working on a data visualization app, having real data can help to determine if the data viz is providing any insight.</p>\n<p>Heroku provides a convenient <code>pg:pull</code> command to pull data from a production database on Heroku to a locally running database. It's run from a terminal (given that you've already authenticated via <code>heroku login</code>). The basic structure of the command is:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"bash\" data-index=\"0\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">heroku pg:pull your-heroku-db-name target-local-db-name --app your-heroku-app-name</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Note that this command requires a postgres client to be installed locally, the easiest way on a Mac is via Homebrew: <code>brew update &#x26;&#x26; brew cleanup &#x26;&#x26; brew install postgresql</code> (actually installs both client and server but only client portion is needed).</p>\n<p>The value of <code>your-heroku-app-name</code> is found on your Heroku dashboard, for example <code>mystic-wind-83</code>. The value of <code>your-heroku-db-name</code> can also be found from the Heroku dashboard by clicking on the app, the database name will be listed in the \"Installed add-ons\" section, for example <code>postgresql-sushi-123</code>. Finally, <code>target-local-db-name</code> is the name of a new database that will be created on your local Postgres, for example <code>my_prod_copy</code>. You can name this any valid database name but it must not already exist on your system. Putting this all together, the command would look like:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"bash\" data-index=\"1\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">heroku pg:pull postgresql-sushi-123 my_prod_copy --app mystic-wind-83</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>However, since I'm running Postgres in a Docker container for my app, the <code>pg:pull</code> command returned the following error message:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"\" data-index=\"2\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">heroku-cli: Pulling postgresql-sushi-123 ---&gt; my_prod_copy</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">createdb: error: could not connect to database template1: could not connect to server: No such file or directory</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">\tIs the server running locally and accepting</span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\">\tconnections on Unix domain socket &quot;/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432&quot;?</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>According to the Heroku <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#pg-push-and-pg-pull\">docs</a>, this error can result from not having the Postgres binaries in the <code>$PATH</code> because <code>pg:pull</code> is essentially a wrapper around <code>pg_dump</code>. But this was not the root cause of this error in my case as <code>pg_dump</code> was indeed in the PATH. This can be verified as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"bash\" data-index=\"3\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">&gt;</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk9\">type</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> pg_dump</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">pg_dump is /usr/local/bin/pg_dump</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">&gt;</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk9\">echo</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> $PATH</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">...:/usr/local/bin:...</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>When running Postgres in a Docker container, the <code>PG_HOST</code> environment variable must be specified to tell Heroku where the running Postgres instance is (otherwise it's assuming localhost). For Docker, the value is <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Also, if you've specified a Postgres root user and password, those must also be specified as environment variables for the <code>pg:pull</code> command.</p>\n<p>For example, my Postgres container is started via <code>docker-compose up</code> using the following <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"yml\" data-index=\"4\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">version</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;3.8&quot;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">services</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk7\">database</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">image</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">postgres:13</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">volumes</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      - </span><span class=\"mtk6\">db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      - </span><span class=\"mtk6\">./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">ports</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      - </span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;5432:5432&quot;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk7\">environment</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      </span><span class=\"mtk7\">POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">somethingSomething</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">      </span><span class=\"mtk7\">POSTGRES_USER</span><span class=\"mtk1\">: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">postgres</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk7\">volumes</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk7\">db_data</span><span class=\"mtk1\">:</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>So the final working command for Heroku to pull the production database to a local copy when using Docker is:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"bash\" data-index=\"5\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=somethingSomething PGHOST=127.0.0.1 heroku pg:pull postgresql-sushi-123 my_prod_copy --app mystic-wind-83</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Now you can connect to your newly created local database <code>my_prod_copy</code>. Note that the <code>pg:pull</code> command will not copy the production user/role, so you'll have to connect with your <code>POSTGRES_USER/POSTGRES_PASSWORD</code> credentials.</p>\n<h2>Related Content</h2>\n<p>The following section contains affiliate links for related content you may find useful.

The standard tools to make these are Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, or Google Slides. These will get the job done, with PowerPoint and Keynote being more feature rich than the free Google Slides.</p>\n<p>However, if you're a web developer, there is another option. <a href=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/\">RevealJS</a> is a JavaScript framework that allows you to leverage your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to build beautiful and polished presentations. Some benefits this has over the standard software packages include being able to use version control (since the presentation is just html, css, and js files rather than a proprietary binary format), collaborate with others, and the sheer joy of using your favorite web technologies and text editor.</p>\n<p>This post will walk you through how to get started with RevealJS, build a simple presentation, and publish it to Github Pages so you can share it with the world. If you want a quick \"reveal\" so to speak, here is the sample <a href=\"https://danielabar.github.io/demo-presentation/\">presentation</a> we're going to be building and the <a href=\"https://github.com/danielabar/demo-presentation\">source</a>.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The build tooling for RevealJS uses <a href=\"https://nodejs.org\">Node.js</a> so make sure you have that installed. I like to be on the latest LTS version.</p>\n<p>Start by cloning the RevealJS repo from Github, installing the dependencies, then run the dev server:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"bash\" data-index=\"0\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">git clone git@github.com:hakimel/reveal.js.git</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk3\"># rename the directory to whatever you like</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">mv reveal.js demo-presentation</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk9\">cd</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> demo-presentation</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">npm install</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">npm start</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>At this point, you should be able to navigate to <a href=\"http://0.0.0.0:8000\">http://0.0.0.0:8000</a> and view the simple presentation that comes with the repo. Use the left/right arrow keys to navigate back and forth, or click on the caret icons displayed on the bottom of the slide. As you navigate the slides, notice the url changes, eg: <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/#/1</code> and a blue progress bar animates across the bottom of the page. All these features are configurable as we'll learn later.</p>\n<p>Now we're ready to start building the presentation.</p>\n<h2>Slides</h2>\n<p>Open the <code>demo-presentation</code> project (or whatever you called it in the Getting Started step earlier) in your editor of choice. I'll be using VS Code.</p>\n<p>Open the file <code>index.html</code> - this is where you'll be making the majority of changes. The entire presentation is contained in a div with a class of <code>slides</code>, which is contained in another div with a class of <code>reveal</code>. Each <code>&#x3C;section>content...&#x3C;/section></code> element denotes a slide.</p>\n<p>Right now it looks as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"1\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">div</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;reveal&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">div</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;slides&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Slide 1&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Slide 2&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">div</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">div</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Delete the two <code>&#x3C;section></code> elements that came with the repo, and replace them with some content as shown below:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"2\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h1</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Demo Presentation&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h1</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;I&#39;m a Sub Heading&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Here is some content.&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;and more content!&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>As soon as you save the changes, the presentation should refresh in the browser. The auto-refresh feature is provided by the development server that comes with the project. At this point, there are still two slides but the content has changed. Notice the default styles that get applied for <code>&#x3C;h1></code>, <code>&#x3C;h2></code>, and <code>&#x3C;p></code> elements. Don't worry if you don't exactly like these styles, everything's customizable.</p>\n<p>Also notice how everything is centered and pleasing to look at. Try resizing the browser window or use Device Mode in Chrome devtools. Mobile/responsive design is already built into the presentation styles, nice!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 800px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f4f5b210d166153e847f8805ec659bcb/27b8e/revealjs-slide1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 69.377990430622%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"slide 1\"\n        title=\"slide 1\"\n        src=\"/static/f4f5b210d166153e847f8805ec659bcb/5a190/revealjs-slide1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f4f5b210d166153e847f8805ec659bcb/772e8/revealjs-slide1.png 200w,\n/static/f4f5b210d166153e847f8805ec659bcb/e17e5/revealjs-slide1.png 400w,\n/static/f4f5b210d166153e847f8805ec659bcb/5a190/revealjs-slide1.png 800w,\n/static/f4f5b210d166153e847f8805ec659bcb/27b8e/revealjs-slide1.png 836w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 800px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b19687feab7fa9d965828205550659a/27b8e/revealjs-slide2.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 69.377990430622%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"slide 2\"\n        title=\"slide 2\"\n        src=\"/static/8b19687feab7fa9d965828205550659a/5a190/revealjs-slide2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b19687feab7fa9d965828205550659a/772e8/revealjs-slide2.png 200w,\n/static/8b19687feab7fa9d965828205550659a/e17e5/revealjs-slide2.png 400w,\n/static/8b19687feab7fa9d965828205550659a/5a190/revealjs-slide2.png 800w,\n/static/8b19687feab7fa9d965828205550659a/27b8e/revealjs-slide2.png 836w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Vertical Slides</h2>\n<p>Generally a presentation progresses linearly from left to right across each slide. But sometimes, the content needs to go off on a tangent, say to explain some point in more detail before moving on with the rest of the presentation. Vertical slides are a great way to organize this type of content. To try this out, nest a <code>&#x3C;section></code> element inside another element like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"3\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;This will remain visible for all vertical slides&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Here is some vertical content&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;and some more&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;more stuff...&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Save the changes, then navigate to the third slide in the presentation. Notice there's now a down caret in addition to the left pointing caret. Click it (or press the down arrow), the slides will now start to transition according to the nested <code>&#x3C;section></code> elements. This only works one level deep, do not try to nest any deeper. At any point the usual left/right key or arrow navigation still works to move to the previous or next slides.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

This is useful when you don't want all the content to show up at once. A classic example is a bullet point list where you want to talk to each point one at a time. To add visibility animation to any element, simply add <code>class=\"fragment\"</code>.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"7\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;fragments in DOM order&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">ul</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;fragment&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;This item will be displayed first&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;fragment&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;This item will be second&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;fragment&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;And this will be last&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">ul</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Use the left/right arrow keys to have the elements animate in, or click on the caret icon at the bottom of the presentation.</p>\n<p>By default, fragments will animate in the same order that they appear in the DOM. The order can be controlled by adding <code>data-fragment-index</code> to any element that has a <code>class=\"fragment\"</code>. For example, to display a list in reverse order:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"8\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Fragments in Custom Order&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">ul</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;fragment&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">data-fragment-index</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;3&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Third&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;fragment&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">data-fragment-index</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;2&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Second&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;fragment&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">data-fragment-index</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;First&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">li</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">ul</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>The default animation is for elements to fade in. But there are a number of other animations available such as fade up, down, left, right, changing color etc. To use these other effects, add the appropriate class to the fragment. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"9\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;Another Fragment Example&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">h2</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;fragment fade-left&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;I will fade in from the left&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>The RevealJS docs list all the possible <a href=\"https://revealjs.com/fragments/\">fragment animation classes</a>.</p>\n<h2>Custom CSS</h2>\n<p>The framework comes with a lot of built in styles for headers, paragraphs, lists etc. It's possible to customize any of these by adding the <code>data-state</code> attribute to any <code>&#x3C;section></code> element.</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"10\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">data-state</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;my-style&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;I&#39;m special!&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>The <code>data-state</code> attribute causes the value, in this example <code>my-style</code> to be added as a class on the <code>&#x3C;body></code> element. This allows for overriding of the framework styles by using a selector such as <code>.my-style p</code>.</p>\n<p>One thing I couldn't find in the docs was where to place custom styles. The quickest way for now is to add a file in the dist dir such as <code>dist/custom.css</code> and then add a link to it in the <code>&#x3C;head></code> section of <code>index.html</code>, after all the framework css is loaded:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"11\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span

helpful feature when giving a talk is the ability to have speaker notes displayed in a separate window from the presentation. RevealJS makes it easy to add these. Add an <code>&#x3C;aside class=\"notes\"></code> element anywhere in a <code>&#x3C;section></code> element (i.e. slide), then that content will not be displayed in the\nslide, for example:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"html\" data-index=\"13\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;This slide has some speaker notes&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">p</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">aside</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> </span><span class=\"mtk5\">class</span><span class=\"mtk1\">=</span><span class=\"mtk6\">&quot;notes&quot;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    These are the speaker notes.</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    They are only visible in a separate window after pressing the s key.</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  &lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">aside</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">section</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>From the browser where the presentation is being displayed, press <kbd>s</kbd> to reveal the speaker notes in a new browser window. This window also conveniently has a timer, and displays the current and upcoming slide to help keep you on track. It looks something like this:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 800px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5124f47427c95a175898d19db0c32fec/66465/speaker-notes.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 68.55059252506838%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"speaker notes\"\n        title=\"speaker notes\"\n        src=\"/static/5124f47427c95a175898d19db0c32fec/5a190/speaker-notes.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5124f47427c95a175898d19db0c32fec/772e8/speaker-notes.png 200w,\n/static/5124f47427c95a175898d19db0c32fec/e17e5/speaker-notes.png 400w,\n/static/5124f47427c95a175898d19db0c32fec/5a190/speaker-notes.png 800w,\n/static/5124f47427c95a175898d19db0c32fec/66465/speaker-notes.png 1097w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Themes</h2>\n<p>By now you'll have noticed there's some common styling applied to all the slides such as a black background and blocky white text.

But to further customize the presentation, there's a <code>&#x3C;script></code> section at the bottom of <code>index.html</code> where the framework gets initialized. Here you can control many features of how the presentation will behave. For example, by default, the slides transition with a slide animation going from right to left. This can be changed by specifying the <code>transition</code> property of the object passed to the <code>Reveal.initialize</code> function.</p>\n<p>For example, to use a <code>convex</code> transition:</p>\n<pre class=\"grvsc-container gatsby-highlight monokai\" data-language=\"js\" data-index=\"16\"><code class=\"grvsc-code\"><span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mtk7\">script</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  // More info about initialization </span><span class=\"mtk8\">&amp;</span><span class=\"mtk1\"> config:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  // - https://revealjs.com/initialization/</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  // - https://revealjs.com/config/</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  Reveal.initialize(</span><span class=\"mtk7\">{</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    hash: </span><span class=\"mtk4\">true</span><span class=\"mtk1\">,</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk3\">// Add your config here:</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    transition: </span><span class=\"mtk6\">&#39;convex&#39;</span><span class=\"mtk1\">,</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    </span><span class=\"mtk3\">// Learn about plugins: https://revealjs.com/plugins/</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">    plugins: [RevealMarkdown, RevealHighlight, RevealNotes]</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">  </span><span class=\"mtk7\">}</span><span class=\"mtk1\">);</span></span></span>\n<span class=\"grvsc-line\"><span class=\"grvsc-source\"><span class=\"mtk1\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"mtk7\">script</span><span class=\"mtk1\">&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>\n<h2>Further Customization</h2>\n<p>Besides slide transitions, many more features of the framework can be controlled through configuration.

I hope you'll give this a try next time you're giving a talk and good luck with your presentation!</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n  .monokai {\n    background-color: #272822;\n    color: #f8f8f2;\n  }\n  .monokai .mtki { font-style: italic; }\n  .monokai .mtk1 { color: #F8F8F2; }\n  .monokai .mtk3 { color: #75715E; }\n  .monokai .mtk9 { color: #66D9EF; }\n  .monokai .mtk7 { color: #F92672; }\n  .monokai .mtk5 { color: #A6E22E; }\n  .monokai .mtk6 { color: #E6DB74; }\n  .monokai .mtk4 { color: #AE81FF; }\n  .monokai .mtk8 { color: #F8F8F0; }\n  .monokai .grvsc-line-highlighted::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1));\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5));\n  }\n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/build-and-publish-presentation-with-html-and-css/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
