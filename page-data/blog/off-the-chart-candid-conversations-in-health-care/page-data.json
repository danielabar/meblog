This post is different.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Over the past several months, a loved one has been dealing with a serious and complex medical issue. Without going into details, I'll just say that it's involved nearly every touchpoint in the Canadian health care system: emergency rooms, hospital stays, numerous diagnostic tests, specialists, telehealth, family doctors, and even surgery.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">As a technologist, I'm used to learning systems inside and out. I like to make informed decisions based on clear information. This involves weighing tradeoffs, assessing risks, and choosing the best path forward. But navigating the medical system as a patient advocate has felt less like debugging a system and more like trying to read tea leaves. The hardest part hasn't been the complexity, it's been the communication.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"medical-communication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#medical-communication\" aria-label=\"medical communication permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Medical Communication</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">At almost every step of the process, I've found myself asking questions that don't get clear answers. Not because the clinicians are rude or dismissive (although on occasion this has happened), many have been kind and well-intentioned. But the <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">way</em> they communicate is often deeply unsatisfying and leaves me feeling no further informed as before the conversation began.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">For example, we were once weighing whether to pursue a less invasive diagnostic test before considering a more invasive and risky surgical procedure. When asked about the less invasive option, the clinician acknowledged that it existed - but said it was hard to get, involved a lot of paperwork, and wasn't commonly done. I was attempting to get at something like: Are you not recommending it because it's not useful as a diagnostic tool? Or because it's a bureaucratic hassle to get approval? If the test were as easy to order as an ultrasound, would you view it as worthwhile? But I wasn't able to get a straight answer.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">That interaction is far from unique. Again and again, I've encountered hedging, and vague reassurances, but rarely direct, transparent reasoning. It often feels like I'm talking to someone who knows the answer, but is <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">afraid to say it plainly</em>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"better-answers-from-an-ai\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#better-answers-from-an-ai\" aria-label=\"better answers from an ai permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Better Answers from an AI?</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">I've found myself turning to ChatGPT for clearer answers to medical questions, not because it’s always correct, but because it communicates openly, without the usual hesitations.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Obviously, it doesn’t replace medical expertise. But it has one key advantage: it’s not afraid to be imperfect. It doesn’t have a license to protect or a career on the line. It’s not practicing defensive medicine or navigating institutional liability. It just provides the answers, with the usual disclaimer that \"AI can make mistakes.\"</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">And unlike some clinicians I’ve encountered, it never dismisses my questions as naïve or irrelevant. It doesn't respond with condescension or veiled annoyance. It takes every query seriously, whether I'm asking about a rare side effect or if it's possible to take public transit home after a procedure. And when pressed for evidence, it offers links to published research, clinical trials, numerical risk estimates, and can even help apply that data to a decision-making framework.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">That’s what I wish I could get from doctors. Not infallibility. Not guarantees. Just a clear, respectful explanation of how they’re thinking. What factors they’re weighing. What’s real versus what’s just administrative policy or political constraint.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Which got me thinking: why doesn’t medicine have an equivalent of \"off the record\"?</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"journalism-off-the-record\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#journalism-off-the-record\" aria-label=\"journalism off the record permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Journalism: Off The Record</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">In journalism, sources and reporters can use the convention of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)#Ethical_guidelines\" class=\"markdown-link\">off the record</a> to speak more freely.
