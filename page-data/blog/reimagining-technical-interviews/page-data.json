In this session, the candidate gets on a video call with an engineer(s) at the hiring company, and is told to click a link to a shared coding environment such as CodeSignal, CoderPad, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">They are presented with a problem to solve, often in the form of: Write a method that takes arguments <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, etc. and produces some output <code>baz</code>. This could be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeetCode\" class=\"markdown-link\">LeetCode</a> style question involving computer science theory. For example <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/\" class=\"markdown-link\">Reverse a Linked List</a>, <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/\" class=\"markdown-link\">Merge K Sorted Lists</a>, <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/description/\" class=\"markdown-link\">Spiral Matrix</a>. Or it could be a question from the company's domain.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">It's a timed exercise, usually under an hour. The candidate is expected to talk out loud as they're solving the coding challenge to explain their thought process. They must also consider appropriate data structures, efficiency (i.e. Big O complexity analysis), and clean code principles such as legibility.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This is often used as a <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">qualifying</em> round, meaning if the candidate does not complete the task in the expected time with expected quality, they are immediately eliminated from the process. In other words, this live exam is used as a gate-keeping exercise, to keep out people who don't do well under this very specific set of circumstances.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"problems\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#problems\" aria-label=\"problems permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Problems</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">The technical round of live coding interviews, while common, has several flaws that can inadvertently exclude talented individuals who might be a great fit for the role.

Often, the complexity in software engineering comes from trying to figure out <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">what</em> to build rather than <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">how</em> to build it. In over 20 years of software development, the only time I've encountered a linked list was in computer science classes at school!</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">If and when a more algorithmic style of problem is encountered, it can be looked up rather than having memorized computer science theory from one's school days. When these problems do come up on the job, they're usually on projects spanning weeks or even months, so the code is not arrived at in one hour. Some public examples I can share from courses and side projects include graph generation for an <a href=\"https://github.com/danielabar/globi-proto/blob/master/app/scripts/services/graphservice.js\" class=\"markdown-link\">interactive exploration of marine ecosystem species</a>,  <a href=\"https://github.com/danielabar/canve-viz/commit/d026efa6b8f0c9841549040305e0694277bff4a4\" class=\"markdown-link\">optimize text placement along an svg path</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/danielabar/coursera-webgl/tree/master\" class=\"markdown-link\">matrix manipulation for 3D computer graphics</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/danielabar/framegen/blob/master/FramegenCore/src/main/java/com/framegen/core/framehandler/option/ArcFrameHandler.java\" class=\"markdown-link\">generation of points along an arc for custom animation</a>. All of these were long running projects that involved many iterations, and the algorithmic problems were contextual to the domain.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">As for Big-O complexity analysis, while this is a useful principle to understand, it doesn't make sense to gate-keep on this. I have resolved many performance issues over the years, and the root cause has never been from a method that was written in O(n) time when it could have been O(log n). Common causes of performance issues in web applications include: Loading too much data from the server (eg: lack of pagination), missing database indices, database tuning/configuration, N+1 queries, lack of (or misconfigured) background task processing, or loading too much JavaScript, such as trackers or non-minified code in the browser.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Additionally, LeetCode problems can exclude candidates who lack a theoretical computer science background but have all the relevant on-the-job experience required for the role.</p>\n<aside class=\"markdown-memory-lane\">\n<h3>Trip down memory lane...</h3>\n<p>\nAn argument could be made that this is a useful interview technique for a junior engineer, as a recent computer science or bootcamp graduate may not have significant real world experience. There may be some truth to this, but even so, I recall as a junior, being struck by just how different the demands of an engineering job were from school assignments.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, one of my first work tasks was to integrate an affiliates program into a retailer's e-commerce system. This involved discussions with the marketing team to determine what they actually needed, reading documentation from the affiliates vendor to understand the integration options, discussions with the operations team to determine potential performance impacts, analysis of the database to determine what changes were required to the data model, analysis of a large code base and framework to determine where to hook in the new code, and of course, some actual coding of the solution. The biggest challenge was figuring out what to build and how to integrate into the existing code.\n</p>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"markdown-aside\">\nFurther discussion on LeetCode style interviewing can be found on <a class=\"markdown-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pbyn4v/comment/haf88zj/\">Reddit Career Questions</a> and this <a class=\"markdown-link\" href=\"https://syntax.fm/show/781/potluck-the-value-of-typescript-vue-vs-svelte-leetcode/\">Syntax podcast</a> episode at 36:15.\n</aside>\n<h3 class=\"markdown-sub-subtitle\" id=\"time-pressure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#time-pressure\" aria-label=\"time pressure permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Time Pressure</h3>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Even if companies choose a problem from their domain rather than theoretical computer science exercises, there are still problems with the timed live coding round.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">The artificial time constraint creates a \"race against the clock mentality\", which can create a \"fight or flight\" response.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Onboarding and product training for a new employee typically take at least a few weeks. This mismatch in expectations can further exacerbate the stress and pressure felt during the interview.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Additionally, in a typical development cycle, the very first solution that comes to mind is almost never the one that gets delivered to production. Instead, there's a period of days or even weeks spent refining the solution, addressing edge cases, and ensuring robustness. Yet, live coding interviews judge candidates based on their ability to immediately produce a fairly polished solution.</p>\n<aside class=\"markdown-memory-lane\">\n<h3>Trip down memory lane...</h3>\nI can recall very few scenarios in my career where the ability to write some code, literally within a few hours, was critical to the team's success. In one instance, the team was told at the last minute that an important client representative was scheduled to come by the next day for a demo. The product was working, but wasn't yet styled, so it looked broken. I had just a few hours to make the views look functional. And even then, it was a product I had been working on for nearly half a year and was therefore very familiar with.

Since then, modern practices in deployment and continuous integration have significantly enhanced the ability to manage these issues.\n</aside>\n<h3 class=\"markdown-sub-subtitle\" id=\"lack-of-empathy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lack-of-empathy\" aria-label=\"lack of empathy permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Lack of Empathy</h3>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">The nature of the live coding \"solve this method\" type of question can induce a lack of empathy on the side of the assessor.

I would encourage everyone who has a say in defining interview processes to open up your company's performance review template for the role, and identify the key points that engineers are evaluated on. For example, here's a few from my past roles as senior and staff engineer:</p>\n<ul class=\"markdown-list-unordered\">\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Technical skills</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Code quality</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Communication</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Conducting effective PR reviews</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Mentoring</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Problem solving &#x26; root cause analysis</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Prioritizing</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Collaboration &#x26; teamwork</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Technical leadership</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Scalable and performant solutions</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Process improvements</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Adaptability &#x26; continuous learning</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Then open up the project team's retrospectives for the past few months, and review what went well and what didn't. Try to identify some themes for what makes engineering successful at your organization and what are the challenges. I've never been in a retrospective that recorded \"This sprint didn't go well because the developers couldn't figure out whether an array or hash was appropriate in this method\".</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">The outcome of the above brainstorming can be used to guide the interview process, thinking about how to assess for qualities the company needs for successful engineering teams. Of course technical proficiency will be up there, but so will other qualities.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\"><strong class=\"markdown-strong\">Another important consideration is the format:</strong> Some topics are suitable for a conversational/real-time format, such as discussions about the candidate's past experiences. On the other hand, \"forging new knowledge\", where the candidate is asked to solve a problem, is generally more suited to asynchronous style, where the candidate works through a problem on their own, and then there's a follow on conversation about the solution.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">The next sections describe some alternatives. Not to suggest that <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">all</em> of these should be used, rather, this is to get people thinking about alternative ways of assessing technical proficiency.</p>\n<h3 class=\"markdown-sub-subtitle\" id=\"greenfield-a-very-small-project\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#greenfield-a-very-small-project\" aria-label=\"greenfield a very small project permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Greenfield a Very Small Project</h3>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">In my experience, the reason projects struggle is often related to communication issues, in understanding business requirements and understanding what other developers did previously. In this case, here's an alternative to the live coding round to assess both technical skills and the ability to communicate effectively.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Email the candidate an assignment they'll do on their own. Intentionally make the problem statement vague, the way a business person might word things. Let the candidate know that the first part of the assignment is for them to take the time to think about clarifying questions, and to email back a list of questions to the company. Emphasize they're being evaluated on their questions at this point, not on knowing the answers. And it's ok to send a question like \"I'm not familiar with this business process, can you share more detailed steps on what's involved here\".</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Then the team assessing the candidate can send back answers to the questions. The answers should be worded in such a way that the solution can be completed in a few hours, i.e. not much longer than the live coding round would have been.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Then the candidate can go ahead and solve the problem on their own time, with their own editor, tooling, keyboard shortcuts etc. This is very reflective of how things happen on the job. Based on questions developers think of, often the product manager will be like \"Good question! I hadn't thought of that case\". Then the solution may take a different shape.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">If writing automated tests is important to the company, as part of the assignment, let the candidate know to include <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">some</em> automated testing. This need not include 100% coverage as that's more time than can reasonably be asked of someone who is doing unpaid work. However, the goal here is to see if they can identify the critical path(s) in the code and ensure these are covered with meaningful tests.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">If engineering documentation is important to the company, as part of the assignment, let the candidate know to provide setup and \"how to\" instructions in the Readme so that the assessor can setup the project and reproduce the solution. Tell them that the goal of this write-up is to ensure that another developer could pick up where they left off and further enhance the product.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">After the candidate submits the solution, a follow-on meeting can be scheduled to discuss it. Such as what was the most challenging part, why the given solution was chosen, what trade-offs were considered etc. Part of the assessment can also include, how easy was it to follow along with the setup instructions? How easy would it be to enhance the solution to add more features?</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\"><strong class=\"markdown-strong\">Benefits of this alternative approach:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Captures essential skills that impact projects, beyond writing working code such as analytical thought, automated testing, engineering documentation, and overall communication.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Due to the dynamic nature of what questions the candidate may ask, the solution could be different for each candidate. This means the assessor doesn't know the exact solution at the start of the assignment. This can improve empathy for the candidate in the process because everyone is figuring out the solution as part of the process. This avoids the fixed mindset of this candidate got the solution correct, good or incorrect, bad.</p>\n<h3 class=\"markdown-sub-subtitle\" id=\"add-a-feature\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#add-a-feature\" aria-label=\"add a feature permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Add a Feature</h3>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Engineers spend a lot more time reading code other people wrote to determine where their new code fits in, rather than starting from a blank slate.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">A variation on the previous assessment (again to be done asynchronously) is to send the candidate some working code.

Given that someone has free time to dedicate to technical extra-curricular activities, I can think of more meaningful things to be doing such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"markdown-list-unordered\">\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Taking online courses to learn a new skill.</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Reading technical books.</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Building a side project to solve an <a href=\"https://syntax.fm/show/119/hasty-treat-better-living-through-side-projects\" class=\"markdown-link\">actual problem</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Volunteering to build software for an charitable organization.</li>\n<li class=\"markdown-list-item\">Writing technical articles, tutorials, create a course etc. to share knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">To be clear, I'm <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">not</em> suggesting people <em class=\"markdown-emphasis\">should</em> be spending their spare time doing any of the above. What I'm suggesting is that if someone has spare time that they'd like to spend on career development, the above can be more impactful than practicing LeetCode exercises.</p>\n<h3 class=\"markdown-sub-subtitle\" id=\"fairness\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#fairness\" aria-label=\"fairness permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fairness</h3>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Another push-back from companies when suggesting alternatives to the live-coding round is the desire to be \"fair\" by having everyone go through the exact same process. However, forcing all candidates through the same gate-keeping mechanism isn't genuinely fair.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">I've been on the other side of the interview process and approach it with a legitimate curiosity about the candidate's experience. For example, if a candidate has listed both Kafka and RabbitMQ on their resume, then I'm going to ask them about that - such as what worked well and didn't work well on projects where they used these, what different behaviour did they observe on the projects that used these, what would they do differently if starting those projects from scratch, when would they use one vs the other, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">The fairness doctrine would suggest that I must ask every candidate the exact same list of questions. But if interviewing another candidate that hasn't used any messaging systems, would it really be fair to ask them questions about Kafka and RabbitMQ?</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">It's important to recognize that different candidates have different strengths and bring different valuable skills to the table. A one-size-fits-all approach can exclude talented individuals who would excel in the actual work environment. By offering alternative assessments, companies can create a more equitable hiring process that better identifies the most qualified candidates, regardless of their performance under artificially high-pressure conditions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"markdown-sub-subtitle\" id=\"cheating\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cheating\" aria-label=\"cheating permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cheating</h3>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">A concern companies may have regarding take-home assignments is the possibility of cheating, such as using generative AI or referencing external resources like Google or Stack Overflow. Throughout history, new tools and technologies often faced skepticism and were initially viewed as cheating.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">However, the use of online resources like Google, Stack Overflow, and more recently, generative AI should be seen not as cheating, but as leveraging available tools to solve complex problems efficiently. If an existing employee uses Copilot, Google, or Stack Overflow to find a solution to a work-related problem, is that considered cheating?</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">The interview process needs to evolve with available tools. For example, allowing candidates to use generative AI during assessments can provide insights into their problem-solving approach, as in, can they spot the issues with the generated code such as bugs or maintainability issues. The ability of tools to generate code instantly, while not perfect, signals that gating candidates based on the skill of generating code on the spot may no longer be relevant.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"suitable-scenarios-for-live-coding\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#suitable-scenarios-for-live-coding\" aria-label=\"suitable scenarios for live coding permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Suitable Scenarios for Live Coding</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">There are some scenarios where a live coding assessment may be useful.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">In early-stage startups, the pace is extremely fast, and the priority is to deliver functional code as quickly as possible. This is not unlike a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon\" class=\"markdown-link\">hackathon</a>, where the ability to jump in and write code rapidly is crucial. Frequent emergencies and production issues, which are likely in such settings due to the lack of extensive testing and established processes, require engineers who can quickly address problems and implement solutions on the fly.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 400px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"airplane quick fix\"\n        title=\"airplane quick fix\"\n        src=\"/static/d2f93b131b1c9f73e13782b489cafd37/066f9/airplane-quick-fix.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d2f93b131b1c9f73e13782b489cafd37/e07e9/airplane-quick-fix.jpg 200w,\n/static/d2f93b131b1c9f73e13782b489cafd37/066f9/airplane-quick-fix.jpg 400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Another scenario could be a company that exclusively does pair, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_programming#Mob_programming\" class=\"markdown-link\">mob programming</a>, where engineers collaborate continuously, either in pairs or in larger groups, to write code together in real-time. This setup emphasizes real-time problem-solving, and constant \"out loud\" communication.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">If a live coding round is necessary, provide candidates with the category of the problem beforehand so they can focus their preparation efforts accordingly. Ideally, this will be only one part of the overall process on which a candidate is being evaluated on, rather than a qualifier.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This post has covered the shortcomings of current technical interview methods, particularly focusing on the live coding round, which often fails to accurately assess the skills and capabilities crucial for real-world software engineering roles. From biased evaluation against diverse thinking styles to unrealistic time pressures, this practice can inadvertently exclude qualified candidates.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">However, there is hope for improvement. By re-evaluating the assessment criteria to align more closely with the skills that drive successful engineering projects, a more effective and inclusive hiring process is possible.</p>\n<style
