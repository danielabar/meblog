Occasionally it produced something useful, but more often it created a mess - not quite what I wanted, or code that wouldn't even work. Cleaning up or undoing those attempts often took longer than writing it myself. It felt impulsive, like the work of a student who had recently learned to code but had little real-world experience.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Over time, I realized that rushing straight to code with AI doesn't scale well in large, long-lived codebases. Unlike quick side projects, hackathon prototypes, or throwaway experiments, substantial features in production systems are often broken down, shipped incrementally (sometimes behind feature flags), and expected to remain understandable long after the original authors have moved on.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This post covers a workflow I've settled into that treats AI primarily as a design partner rather than a code generator. It's slower than \"just write the code\", but scales much better for non-trivial changes and helps maintain clarity, intent, and maintainability over time.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Just a quick clarification before moving on: in this post, \"AI\" refers specifically to large language model (LLM) based coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and similar tools.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"the-core-idea\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-core-idea\" aria-label=\"the core idea permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Core Idea</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">I don't ask AI to start by writing code.

That document becomes the durable artifact of the work: a design checkpoint I can read calmly, revisit later, and keep even if the session ends. I open it in VS Code's markdown preview and review it the same way I would any design doc, which I find far easier than parsing long terminal output.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This flips the dynamic: The AI's reasoning is explicit and reviewable, not hidden behind (often false) confidence. If the understanding is wrong, we fix it here, before new requirements enter the picture and muddy the waters.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This document is the first durable artifact in the workflow. As the work progresses, I keep understanding and decisions persisted in markdown rather than letting them live in terminal scrollback or my head.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"introduce-new-requirement\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#introduce-new-requirement\" aria-label=\"introduce new requirement permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Introduce New Requirement</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Only after we're aligned on the current system do I introduce the new requirement. At that point, I ask the AI to explore the solution space by considering multiple possible approaches, rather than jumping straight to an answer. I want to see multiple viable approaches, grounded in the project's existing patterns, with tradeoffs called out clearly.</p>\n<aside class=\"markdown-aside\">\nNew requirements can be introduced in different ways: you might paste text from Notion, Confluence, or a ticket; or, if using Jira, you can set up the <a class=\"markdown-link\" href=\"https://github.com/atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server/\">Atlassian MCP server</a> to let the AI read ticket descriptions directly.\n</aside>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This is a useful moment to gauge how the AI is reasoning: what it thinks is possible, how it weighs constraints, and whether it respects the shape of the codebase instead of trying to redesign it. That analysis goes into a second markdown document alongside the first. The initial document becomes reference material, while the new one becomes the active working surface for exploring requirements and design decisions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"ask-me-questions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ask-me-questions\" aria-label=\"ask me questions permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ask Me Questions</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">At this stage, I ask the AI to review the new requirements in the context of the system analyzed so far and identify areas where clarification is needed. I then instruct it to list those as questions in an <code>## Outstanding Questions</code> section of the analysis document. We then work through them exactly as I would with another engineer. One at a time, I answer the questions and the AI updates the analysis document accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">By the end of this phase, assumptions have been corrected and ambiguities reduced, leaving us with a much tighter shared understanding of the system.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\"><strong class=\"markdown-strong\">Catching Subtle Details Early</strong></p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">By forcing the AI to fully analyze the current system before writing code, it can surface complexities that might otherwise be overlooked. For example, while summarizing the existing feature set, the AI might notice that different functionality is available depending on a user's subscription tier. If a new feature overlaps with these tiers, this early analysis highlights the need for a policy decision before coding begins, preventing a scenario where the code works technically but violates business rules.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">These are the kinds of issues that usually only come up during testing or code review, but with upfront analysis, they can be caught proactively, keeping the design aligned with the system's constraints.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"outline-work\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#outline-work\" aria-label=\"outline work permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Outline Work</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Once we've converged on an approach, I ask the AI to decompose the work into small, explicit steps and document them. We get concrete here: which files will change, what existing code will be extended versus replaced, and where tests need to be added or updated.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">At this point, the AI is outlining the changes, but nothing is actually modified in the codebase yet. The goal is to answer whether the work is well-scoped and understandable: what changes happen in what order, what can be validated independently, where the risk lies, and whether this belongs in a single pull request or does it seem big enough that it should be split up further. When that plan feels solid, we can move forward.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"implementation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#implementation\" aria-label=\"implementation permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Now we're ready to write code. I ask the AI to implement the first step in the plan. After the code for that step has been written, I review the diff and run tests; automated tests can be handled by the AI, but for UI-related changes I like to exercise them in the browser as a sanity check. Once everything works as expected, the AI updates the analysis document to reflect the completed step.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">We then move on to the next step, repeating the process: implement, review, test, update the document. By keeping changes narrow and reviewable, and persisting context in the markdown document, the work stays aligned with the original plan. This prevents the AI from \"helpfully\" solving problems I didn't agree to solve yet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"why-i-work-this-way\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-i-work-this-way\" aria-label=\"why i work this way permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why I Work This Way</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This workflow leans heavily on written reasoning and documentation, a skill that's been undervalued in tech, but becomes a superpower when working with LLMs. The clearer the engineer can write questions, prompts, and feedback, the better the AI can reason, and produce high quality work.</p>\n<aside class=\"markdown-aside\">\nIf the idea of leveraging written communication skills for more effective engineering is new to you, see a few of my previous posts on this topic:\n<a class=\"markdown-link\" href=\"https://danielabaron.me/blog/reflections-on-effective-teams/#culture-of-writing\">Culture of Writing</a>,\n<a class=\"markdown-link\" href=\"https://danielabaron.me/blog/about-those-docs/\">About Those Docs</a>,\n<a class=\"markdown-link\" href=\"https://danielabaron.me/blog/working-towards-asynchronous-future/#communication\">Communication for Asynchronous Teams</a>\n</aside>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">This approach can feel slower than asking the AI to \"just implement the feature\", especially if speed is being measured by how quickly code is committed to version control. In practice, the tradeoff is overwhelmingly positive. The work becomes far less error-prone because misunderstandings are surfaced early, before they harden into code. It's also much easier to pause and resume: the analysis document captures intent, decisions, and open questions in a way a half-written diff never does. This also aligns with how effective engineering teams already operate - through shared context and incremental change rather than heroic leaps.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">Most importantly, it keeps me in control of the design. The analysis document is the real artifact. The code is just one possible outcome of good thinking.</p>\n<h2 class=\"markdown-subtitle\" id=\"final-thoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts\" aria-label=\"final thoughts permalink\" class=\"markdown-header-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">AI is very good at generating answers. It's less good at knowing whether it understood the question. By externalizing its understanding, forcing iteration, and delaying code, I've found I can use AI on serious work without giving up the things I care about most: clarity, intent, and maintainability.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">With my current process, I spend much more time in back-and-forth analysis and design. By the time we get to writing code, it's usually correct the first time and literally only takes minutes. The upfront time invested in reasoning carefully with the AI pays off massively. The work becomes faster, safer, and more reliable than rushing straight into implementation. This is the power of using AI as a design partner rather than (solely) a code generator.</p>\n<p class=\"markdown-para\">If you already collaborate this way with humans, you don't need a new mindset for AI, you just need to insist on the same standards.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n
